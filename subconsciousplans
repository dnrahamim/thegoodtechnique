sometimes
i'm not sure what is making me feel the way I feel
i feel so sad
or so instensly... something
could be many things
few recent traumas. work stress
sidney eileen born
but probably also
the child we're about to get!
people tell me it's a lot of insane responsibility
okay
i don't feel it
but maybe i do feel it coming
subconsciously
and it's making me sad
because i'm doing subconscious preparations
and the hard work is draining
you see?
