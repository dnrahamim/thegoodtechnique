here
I found out that my basic routine is enough to keep my digestion moving fine
I might get uncomfortably constipated
but I'm basically alright
now.
if things get bad, i might make it bad
that's what i think
when i consider going late tonight to spend time with Bern
who just got broken up by Lisa
but I feel.
I gain strength when I fight the good fight
I am better able to control my eating
in fact, i hardly want to overeat to hurt myself
unless
i'm afraid...
of bern? yes
or shari? also yes
of Dorian? maybe?
I can't fear.
that's hard. because bern is afraid
so is alana
and being with them will make me scared
especially if i'm already scared?
that's okay
take care of dorian?
that's enough
