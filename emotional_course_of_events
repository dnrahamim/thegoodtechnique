bad stuff happens to you.
you store the pain away
to be dealth with later (to be dealt with)
when you let someone close
the pain slips out
it makes you crazy (out of control. you decide how it goes down)

in a relationships
you need to be able to basically act freely
without always restraining yourself
you only needa a few good restraints
if you're always worried about acting like yourself
it makes you wholly stressed
trapped

when you start a relationship
even i one of you is in a much more "position of strength" situation
as the stressed out (one with pain expulsion in progress. pain siphon)
as the pain is coming out you're showing how to deal with that
then when yous finally starts
they will use the habits you've taught to them
to deal with you

fights are inevitable
but they are inevitably draining. you can't make them "not painful" you can only make them "productive"
in a relationship, that means you are signing up for regular pain. like getting a tattoo every week
