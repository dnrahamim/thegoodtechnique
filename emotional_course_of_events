Human Beings are pack animals. Ever tiny aspect of our Brains, Bodies, and DNA expect that we will be surrouneded by other people from the day we're born until the day we die. We have exruciatingly fine-tuned social skills: facial recognition, body language, social customs. And we have very very strong Emotions.

How does a Relationship Go?
The point of a relationship is to get close. The closer we get, the fast we go. The happpier, stronger. The more well-rounded our personalities.

When we enter a relationships, we each bring our boundaries. It's as if we each wearing a huge suit of armor the size of a house. Boundaries are things like, when/how you want to be touched or how you want to be spoken to. That's good and right. But, our armor interferes with getting close to one another.

As time goes on in our relationship, we automatically get closer and closer, wether we like it or not. The force of human gravity pulls us together every time we cross paths. Eventually you get so close that you're starting to cross into my boundaries. You're in the driveway of my little house.

So, to get closer, what I need to do is show you how to act in my house. I basically give you the key to the door. I show you that, in my house, you need to take off your shoes and mind your manners. If you want to touch me, you have to do it the way that makes me feel comfortable and safe.

If I can teach you how to act in my house. And I learn how to act in your little house. Then I can let you get close. Now we're really on a team. The more I see you follow my manners, the more I trust you. The less prepared I am to attack. THis is awesome.

Why are Relationships Hard?
In our past relationships, we get hurt by people we love, and we also hurt the people we love. 

bad stuff happens to you.
you store the pain away
to be dealth with later (to be dealt with)
when you let someone close
the pain slips out
it makes you crazy (out of control. you decide how it goes down)

in a relationships
you need to be able to basically act freely
without always restraining yourself
you only needa a few good restraints
if you're always worried about acting like yourself
it makes you wholly stressed
trapped

when you start a relationship
even i one of you is in a much more "position of strength" situation
as the stressed out (one with pain expulsion in progress. pain siphon)
as the pain is coming out you're showing how to deal with that
then when yous finally starts
they will use the habits you've taught to them
to deal with you

fights are inevitable
but they are inevitably draining. you can't make them "not painful" you can only make them "productive"
in a relationship, that means you are signing up for regular pain. like getting a tattoo every week
