Good behavior isn't what I thought it was
I am learning from shari and dad and rain
You can't tell necesarily someone not to engage in hurtful behaviors
Because, largely, it is what it is
And holding them in isn't really a viable healing process
Or even doable at all
What the important thing is
1. I figure out what i'm going to do to protect myself. disengage maybe
2. I let shari know what I'm doing so it doesn't inflame her more
3. Shari is aware that her hurtful behavior isn't something to do more of
4. She calms down. Next time she doesn't do the hurtful thing as often
