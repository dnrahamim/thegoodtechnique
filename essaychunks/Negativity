Negativity

I want to talk about conflict resolution
and how negativity places into conflict resolution

what is negativity?
negativity is a noticeably negative bias
in the way we see everyone and everything
which goes beyond pure fact
in fact, which distorts pure fact

although some of us prefer to believe that we are exactly neutral
this is like balancing on the head of a pin
just about everyone leans in one direction or another

it is my experience
that negativity is pervasive
just about everyone I know
even people who consider themselves to be positive thinkers
have these deep negative streaks
especially when it comes to other people

for example
my friend david is negative about everything. talks about how his coworkers are dumb assholes. the office workers at his school are incompetent. the class is pointless
shari is negative about her mom. as soon as she answers the phone to talk to her mom, her voice changes. suddenly she sounds very impatient and unhappy
there are points in my life that I have been very negative. I just sat around the room being disgusted by everyone. the people on the sidewalk. the trash in the streets
i meet israeli teenagers. talking about how palestinians are primitives
tad is negative about himself. he always says he's a burden. nobody likes him

remember
this is negativity that goes above and beyond the bare facts
okay, maybe david's coworkers are dumb assholes. but he doesn't say "well, whatever. they're human like anyone else"

of course all this negativity
actually affects your life
david is negative about his coworkers. well he deliberately has bad communication with them. they don't want to promote him
shari pushes her mom away. her mom won't help her when she wants
tad fulfilles that prophecy

when negativity is about places and things
it falls under the category of fantasy
i look at the sidewalk and I just see shitty misery. that's my personal fantasy. that's me making a little nightmare world for myself

but when negativity is about people
that falls under the category of dehumanization
that is, you look at a person
and instead of seeing them as as basically like you
a flawed confused creature
you go a few inches further
say they're just dumb assholes
or i'm just a useless burden
or they can do no wrong
and from then on you relieve yourself of the responsibility
to treat them like you would treat a regular human being

how does this figure into relationships?
and particularly into conflicts

In a relationship with another person
there are always conflicts and confrontations

there are two ways to handle a conflict
you can argue
or you can fight
and the difference is
that arguments are civilized
and fights are not

when I argue with shari
tensions might be high
there might be strong emotions at play
we might even raise our voices

but as long as we keep the kid gloves on
as long as we keep our heads cool
then the argument can actually be
very healthy and productive

they may be stressful. very stressful
but the successful conclusion of an argument
moves a relationship forward
and brings two people closer together

on the other hand
the argument becomes a fight
when things get ugly
that is
when we make personal attacks
say things with the intention to hurt
or neglect how our partner feels

fights are toxic to our relationship
and without deliberate damage control
a fight will drive two people apart

now here's the thing
in any relationship
it's impossible for us to be perfect arguers
we're going to get mad
we're gonna fly off the handle
and that's okay
it's okay to make mistakes
people know how to apologize
we know how to do damage control
as long as we keep our arguments 80% civilized
everything will work out okay

this might be good news
to have a healthy and productive relationship
all we need to do
is stop attacking each other during arguments
simply blunt our weapons
and thus conclude our conflicts
by moving closer together

but that is not good news for most of us
it is actually quite the challenge
because most of us
are filled with negativity
we're not willing to let go of it
and that negativity
primes us
to dehumanize one another

shari is a good example of this
when shari gets mad at me
or even when she thinks i'm mad at her
her mind runs wild
and she loses sight of the real me
instead begins to see me
as if i have little devil horns
and when i get those little horns
the normal rules of conduct go out the window

so once I told her "hey next time we talk to my lawyer, i'd like to do most of the talking"
she felt criticized
so she said "well i'm smarter than you anyway. you never finish anything you start i'm much smarter than you"

I have done the same thing
i don't want shari controlling me
she tells me not to wear a dress
i scream at her "I'M SORRY IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR YOU"

I am aware
that screaming does nothing to help my situation
but I do it
because I am living in a fantasy land
where I allow myself an unhealthy exception
because, although screaming might not work on human beings
i deserve to do it and this is the right thing to do

when bad things happen to us
or when we see injustice in the world
we need to come to terms with those feelings
with the help of trusted loved ones

if we can't come to terms with our negative feelings
in a healthy way
often
we will rationalize our feelings
by developing a negative world view

this is perfectly understandable
if I got picked on at school
and then I got home
and tried to tell my parents
but got screamed at instead
I am not likely to take a charitable view of my bullies
it makes sense that I will use a mental coping strategy
a. i will hate my bullies and all of their race, gender, social class
b. i will come to dislike myself



negativity
is really a lot of imagination
That's why
using your imagination is an effective 




with social creatures
such as wolf or apes
manners are very important
because
they are difficult to master
difficult to fake
and so they are very reliable metric
for your emotional stability
and your reliability as a teammate

and nowhere are manners more important
than in a conflict with your partner

here's how the system works
you are a wolf
you have very strong emotions

a member of your pack steps on your tail
if you bite them in the face
that is bad manners
