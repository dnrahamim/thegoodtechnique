Positive Thinking

I want to talk about a technique
which is, basically, the power of positive thinking
especially thinking positively about other people

there is such a thing as positive psychology
and this field of study
is figuring out that
when you deliberately infuse your life with positivity
remembering to be grateful. seeing the best in other people. taking a second to dance around all silly
it makes a demonstrable difference in your happiness and well-being

now
i had two obstacles between me and positive psychology
1. i used to scoff at the idea/ of "deliberately" being positive
that idea sounds to me like i'm forcing delusions onto myself

2. i was actually quite negative in my life. i still am
it is difficult for me to notice just how negative i am

i want to claim
1. that positive thinking is not delusional thinking. negativity is the real delusion. and positive thinking, especially about other people, is the cure. 

to explain the importance of positive thinking
let's talk about the opposite: negative thinking

it is my experience
that negativity is pervasive
specifically, a negative way of seeing other people

just about everyone I know
have these deep negative streaks

for example
my friend David. He loves his family. he loves his friends. but he loves to complain about how his coworkers are incompetent fools
Shari. She loves children. she loves animals. but as soon as her mom calls her phone, she gets angry impatient
I Dorian. I love strangers. I love humanity. But sometimes I get disgusted everyone. the people on the sidewalk. the people at stop and shop.

now the thing is
negative feelings aren't bad
we have bad days and good days

and our legitimate criticisms of other peopel aren't bad either
david's coworkers may very well be incompetent
the people on the sidewalk may very well be unfeeling cattle

but the problem is
when legitimate criticisms
mix with fear and resentment
and lead us toward counterproductive actions

David is so convinced that he's surrounded by fools, that he doesn't even communicate. So he got let go from that job
Shari yells at her mom. Surprise, they fight
And I isolate myself. And then I get miserable.

what started legitimate
got exagerrated into some strong negativity
to the point that we sabotaged ourselves

this sort of thing happens all the time

for example. my friend Tad thinks he's a big burden
it's obvious to anyone that, despite his flaws, he's not a complete burden. he's just sabotaging himself

the interesting thing is
but if you confront him about it, he'll fight you on it!
he'll argue about how terrible he is
he thinks he's being logical

and it's not just him
all of us are filled with these little delusions

it's clear that
for the sake of bettering our lives
we should rid ourselves of our delusions

to do that
we need to explore the reason why
we have so much trouble seeing the negativity under our own noses

there are probably many reasons
but I will provide one reason which I think is particularly strong

STORY
througout our lives, other people hurt us
they scare us, cheat us, attack us

soon after a bad experience
your memory. of the person and place
is more nightmarish than real

the bad person looks like a demon
and situations that remind us of the bad event
feel frantically scary

now
in order to go on living normal lives
whithout developing phobias
we need to "come to terms" with those feelings

and the way you do this
is with the help of trusted loved ones
you express yourself in an environment of safety and understanding
and this enables you to accept what happened

however
as we know
it is very rare
to have trusted and close family whenever we need them
many bad events go untreated
and we live our lives
accumulating many bad feelings

as a result
with each little nightmare that we accumulate
our understanding of what a human being is
becomes dehumanized
hundreds and hundreds of times
until
this dehumanization of other people
becomes our true reality

most of the time, this dehumanization is subtle
which makes it quite insidious
ther'es a fine line between seeing legitimate flaws in other people
and unwarranted fear and resentment

so for example
i have israeli relatives. intelligent, educated. they have legitimate conflict with palestinians.
but sometimes, if there's been a recentterror attack. they say things like "we need to find the perpetrators and burn down their village"
to an outsider. it's clear that that's monstrous idea
and yet, if you confront them, they will defend their point of view with all our powers of logic

you'd think this effect is subtle
and that you can weed it out by willpower alone
but not always

when I get shari mad
she reverts to the dark place
and cannot be convinced that I'm not about to divorce her
for hours on end
and when she comes to reality
it's like she's a different person

how do we rid ourselves of this bug?
of course, the long term solution is always the same
find some trusted loved ones
express yourself in an environment of safety and understanding
and, like magic
your worldview will come into line with reality

however
that process is long and hard
where do you even find trusted loved ones?
we need some short term strategies

my solution is twofold
1. acknowledgement
I acknowledge. that I have unresolved fears and resentments. and that they cloud my judgement

2. positive thinking
remember. I said that I used to scoff. thinking that positivity was delusional
well, we've shown that negativity is the real delusion
so, we fight imagination with imagination
we need to deliberately see people in a positive light

whoever you find yourself hating
remind yourself that they were once innocent children like you were

whoever you look down on
remind yourself that they are fighting their own personal battle

if you think you are a big burden
think of 3 ways that you are grateful for who you are

if you want to burn down the village of palestinians
imagine their families sitting down to eat

is it the stuff of children's books? yes? does it work? yes absolutely

TECHNIQUE: the acceptance sigh
when you use your positivity in situations that you would prefer to be negative
it's gonna hurt
that's what happens when convenient delusions collide with reality
do this:

take a deep breath
acknowledge that it's about to hurt a little
genty picture the positive thing in your mind
imagine the feeling of your hands letting go. of muscle relaxation
exhale
feel some sadness cross your face (maybe a few tears)
frown a bit

OBJECTIONS
isn't it possible to go to far with the positivity?
what if you end up naively idolizing people?

yes that's possible
but if you look closely
idolization is just another kind of dehumanization
it's not really positive at all

the most positive way to see another person
is the way that first reality:
people are mostly good
always a little bit scared and confused
