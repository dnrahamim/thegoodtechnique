Positive Thinking


i want to claim
that just about everyone is negative
i want to cast doubt on our negative beliefs
i propose that they are more an affliction than a worldview
and offer a solution


When you're dealing with people
you need to be pragmatic
because often
we want things out of people that are impossible for them to give

dehumanization
leads to a few things
like treating people bad
like expecting people to change
misunderstanding their signals



in this piece
I claim that
if you want to have healthy personal relationships
you must learn to view to see
all human beings
in a positive light

to explain the importance of positive thinking
I'll begin with it's opposite:
negative thinking

it is my experience
that negativity is pervasive
specifically, a negative way of seeing other people

just about everyone I know
even people who consider themselves to be positive thinkers
have these deep negative streaks
especially when it comes to particular people

for example
my friend David. He loves his family. he loves his friends. but he loves to complain about how his coworkers are incompetent fools
Shari. She loves children. she loves animals. but as soon as her mom calls her phone, she gets angry impatient
I Dorian. I love strangers. I love humanity. But sometimes I get disgusted everyone. the people on the sidewalk. the people at stop and shop.

now
negativity is not wrong
nor is it necessarily innacurate
david's coworkers may very well be incompetent
the people on the sidewalk may very well be unfeeling cattle

but the problem is
that when negativity gets chronic
it affects your decisionmaking

so
David is not nice to people at work. So he got let go from that job
Shari yells at her mom. Surprise, they fight
And I isolate myself. And then I get miserable.

this raises the question
why does negativity hurt our decisionmaking
even it is perfectly correct
that certain people are incompetent and insufferable?
why should we treat people any differently than they deserve to be treated?

the answer lies something called
Dehumanization



Dehumanization
humans are 3 things
fundamentally good
scared and confused

througout our lives, other people hurt us
they scare us, cheat us, attack us

when these bad things happen
they produce strong negative feelings

for a little while
you remember the person that person in a nightmarish way
more as a monster than a person

we hate them
wish they were dead
assume everyone who even looks like them is evil
it's easy and comfortable
because. if some people are evil
then you can still truest your family

we forget the truth
that all of us are just scared and confused

now
in order to go on living normal lives
we need to "come to terms" with those feelings

that is
we need to bring that nightmarish memory
into line with reality

and the way you do this
is with the help of trusted loved ones
like everything else with human beings
you express yourself in an environment of safety and understanding
you see the goodness of humanity in the faces of your loved ones
and this enables you to accept what happened
so that you can trust people once again

however
as we know
it is very rare and special to have very trusted and close family
and so it is very common
that we never "come to terms" with our strong feelings about other people

as a result
over the years
our nightmares
become our reality
we learn to rationalize them
and develop complex woldviews
based on the faulty premise
that humans are something more sinister
than scared and confused monkeys

dehumanization comes in many forms
we develop racisms
political tribalisms
nationalisms
we hate the rich
or the poor

or we hate ourselves
we assume we are a burden
or unattractive
or unwanted

or we do the opposite. we idolize
we idolize our grandparents
or political figures
or our significant other

or we idolize ourselves



the really insidious thing about this dehumanization
is how subtle it is
it's not that we're wrong to see the flaws in other people
or to admire other people or ourselves very much
there is a fine line
where seeing factual flaws
becomes a fear. an unscientific hatred
a studied ignorance to all our true confused and scared humanity

and it comes out
it's obvious when you look for it
my friend Tad has flaws. it's true. but he goes far out of his way to apologize for being a burden. and to say he's well aware that we don't like him.
i have israeli relative. it's true, they have legitimate conflict with palestinians. but they say things like "we need to find the perpetrators and burn down their village"
or me. remember when I wrote that extremely aggressive essay that I was disgusted by everyone?

the line is not really so fine
and yet, if you confront me or Tad or my relatives, we will defend their point of view with all our powers of logic

now it's easy for outsiders to spot the fallacy
and you might confront me
and say look, you have some legitimate point Dorian but you're taking it too far

the problem is, that what's easy for an outsider to see is almost impossible for me to see
it's right under my nose
and pure logic won't do the trick

I must eliminate the root problem
that I have unresolved fears and resentments

and the way to do that?
I must make for myself
a safe environment of trusted loved ones
and express myself
so that I can come to terms with my feelings
and accept reality
that humans are not demons
no exceptions





how does this figure into relationships?
and particularly into conflicts

In a relationship with another person
there are always conflicts and confrontations

there are two ways to handle a conflict
you can argue
or you can fight
and the difference is
that arguments are civilized
and fights are not

when I argue with shari
tensions might be high
there might be strong emotions at play
we might even raise our voices

but as long as we keep the kid gloves on
as long as we keep our heads cool
then the argument can actually be
very healthy and productive

they may be stressful. very stressful
but the successful conclusion of an argument
moves a relationship forward
and brings two people closer together

on the other hand
the argument becomes a fight
when things get ugly
that is
when we make personal attacks
say things with the intention to hurt
or neglect how our partner feels

fights are toxic to our relationship
and without deliberate damage control
a fight will drive two people apart

now here's the thing
in any relationship
it's impossible for us to be perfect arguers
we're going to get mad
we're gonna fly off the handle
and that's okay
it's okay to make mistakes
people know how to apologize
we know how to do damage control
as long as we keep our arguments 80% civilized
everything will work out okay

but here is the prolem
most of us
are filled with negativity
when we have an argument
and we cut each other down
and say hurtful things
it's not by accident
we're doing it partially on purpose
partially because
our negativity
primes us
to dehumanize one another

in our hearts
we know that nothing good can come of hurting our loved ones
but if we are able to rationalize hurting each other
we'll do it

shari is a good example of this
when shari gets mad at me
or even when she thinks i'm mad at her
her mind runs wild
and she loses sight of the real me
instead begins to see me
as if i have little devil horns
and when i get those little horns
the normal rules of conduct go out the window

so once I told her "hey next time we talk to my lawyer, i'd like to do most of the talking"
she felt criticized
so she said "well i'm smarter than you anyway. you never finish anything you start i'm much smarter than you"

I have done the same thing
i don't want shari controlling me
she tells me not to wear a dress
i scream at her "I'M SORRY IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR YOU"

I am aware
that screaming does nothing to help my situation
but I do it
because I am living in a fantasy land
where I allow myself an unhealthy exception
because, although screaming might not work on human beings
this time. somehow. she really deserved it

this is all pure fantasy
but it inflitrates our world view
to the point that we actually believe it
on a daily basis





the point:
negativity
is really a lot of imagination
That's why
using your imagination is an effective 

you are not up against reality
trying to fool yourself into being positive
you are up against negative fantasy land
and you need to bring yourself back to earth

the other point:
our downfalls in our relationships
and lives
are largely due to our conscious choices
and beliefs
not accidental
and that these negative beliefs are a sort of emotional debt
that we need to pay down

we need to Acceptance
why?
yes
if you agree not to be nasty
to do the soft things. disengage. stonewall
you are making yourself vulnerable to attack
but you are overly vulnerable
against an enemy that doesn't exist
and you are appropriately vulnerable
to the real human being in front of you

techniques:
The Acceptance Sigh
sigh. let it wash over you

The Acceptance Mantra
"it is what it is"
"bring it on"
"let it come"
"it's gonna be okay"




with social creatures
such as wolf or apes
manners are very important
because
they are difficult to master
difficult to fake
and so they are very reliable metric
for your emotional stability
and your reliability as a teammate

and nowhere are manners more important
than in a conflict with your partner

here's how the system works
you are a wolf
you have very strong emotions

a member of your pack steps on your tail
if you bite them in the face
that is bad manners
