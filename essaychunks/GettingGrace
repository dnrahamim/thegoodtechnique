Alan watts raises this paradox
about getting race

it basically reads
"how can you be a good person if you don't want to be a good person?"
if you haven't wanted god in in your life up until now? how do you will yourself do do it?

i say, basically
do something orthogonal
do something else
that you really do have power over
that ultimately gets you to the same place
