the thing about pain

when you have emotional pain
there's no telling what aspect of your self it will affect
you may be physically very strong
but have an addiction to painkillers
or just a lot of trouble focusing

your routines. safe you feel at your job
the p\closeness you get on a regular basis
are you rworld
your body uses their strength
to calculate
if it's time to release the floodgates of the emotions



there's vulnerability because you're unsafe
and then because you're safe
