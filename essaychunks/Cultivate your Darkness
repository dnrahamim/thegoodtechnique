Cultivate your Darkness

"""
We have two wolves inside of us
One good one bad
Which one wins?
The one you feed
"""

Each one of us has a dark side to our personality
which leads us
to disregard other people's feelings
or to take pleasure in hurting other people
to a greater or lesser extent

most of the time
the darkness is small and harmless
for example
we might intentionally piss off our older sister
or hope that some asshole at work gets a flesh-eating virus
fantasize about an underage teenager
or go out of our way to murder the civilians in grand theft auto

other times
the darkess becomes a problem
as is the case
with the vindictive boss or teacher
who orders people around purely for the pleasure of it
or the sort of person
who takes the fantasy into reality
and actually abuses animals or children

this darkess is well-known in philosophical and relgious circles
In the Jewish tradition, it is known as the yetzer ha'ra - the Evil Inclination
In Christianity it is known as Original Sin. Or just the Devil

in most philosophies of human behavior
the path to righteousness is framed
as a battle
between our evil inclination and our good inclination

we are drawn to kill, to steal, and rape
by a devil inside ourselves
and we must constantly fight against our instincts
or risk becoming complete animals

this understanding of what it means to be a good person
is extremely common
practically taken for granted
but I don't buy it

I fully believe that the darkenss is realy
but I don't think that a neverending battle against ourselves
is a healthy or effective way to live with it

In my own personal life
I am aware
I too have a Darkness inside of me

For example
Several years ago
I started having regular violent fantasies

I dreamed that I was in prison
And that, during a fight
I would break someone's legs. Or destroy their face
And that felt good

And I dreamed that my mother had been kidnapped
And I would find her kidnapper
And, one by one
pull out his teeth with my pliers
And that felt good too

As you can imagine
These violent fantasies frightened me
I wondered what was wrong with me
And my solution
Was to simply block those feelings out of my mind
whenever they crept in

however
this solution always left me feeling frustrated
and sickened by myself
never any closer to a calm mind

well one day
I happend to join a club at a university
of mixed amateurs and experts 
who fought each other for fun
a fight club

it was great
I loved getting punched in the face
I loved cracking someone in their face

and my violent fantasies went away
although, I never made the connection

like clockwork, the years went by
more malevolent fantasies
perhaps not violent
but
I'd pace the sidwalk thinking about people who had been mean to me
and I'd pounce on them, holding them down and screaming into their face

and again
I had a stroke of luck
I was in a relationship with a woman
and she admitted, without my asking
that she had a kink for getting hurt

and again, it was great
I loved smacking her
hitting her with a wooden stick, leaving welts

but even then
i never made the connection

skip ahead to the modern day
I'm older now
I am much more sensitive to my emotions
I recently had some emotional struggle
and I found myself having dark thoughts
looking at pictures of 18-year-old girls in bikinis
thinking about biting the ears off the security guard who was mean to me

my childhood response was to repress
bad! bad Dorian!
you are sick! you are shameful!
but then. it finally clicked

it's true
we all have our inner angel and inner demon
but our demon is not a villain to be slain
it is a living creature
with its own needs and desires
which deserve and demand
our respect

the thing about human needs and desires
is that they don't just disappear
they redirect

anyone who studies abstinence only education knows
that if you block the missionary position
kids just have oral and anal sex
or anyone who studies prohibition or the war on drugs knows
people just find other ways to get high

the reason that your needs and desires don't disappear
is that they are not superstitious evil
they are signals
and they are an escape valve

when you are having a bad month
you are more likely to have bad thoughts
which alert you
to some emotional constipation

all of the abuse endured at work and school
has worked its way into a knot
which must be purged

if you follow those scary thoughts
like I did by going to fight club
and doing bdsm
you clear up the blockage
which frees up your angelic nature
to proceed with your daily life

but if you simply ignore your scary thoughts
worse, if you shame and blame yourself for them
then you remain emotionally constipated
and those scary thoughts
become scary actions of some kind or another

they become angry outbursts at loved ones
self-destructive habits, insomnia, the common cold

so
you want your asshole coworker to get ebola?
you owe it to yourself
to imagine that douchebag dying horribly

you like imagining underage girls?
you owe it to your society
to watch some hentai porn about lesbian teenage stepsisters

did you know japan puts dating video games where you can rape people?
did you also know they have one of the lowest rates of sexual assault and rape of any country on earth?

I like hurting people god dammit
I owe it to myself to join a boxing gym
or something

now the obje
