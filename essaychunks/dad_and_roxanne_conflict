Dad felt like he didn't do anything really wrong

More Details
When Dad broke the glass. Dad and Mom were off to pick up Daniel's parents from the airport. None of Dan's brothers in Chicago offered to help

Dad had just spent the whole week fixing Roxanne and Dan's condo. Painting, putting together the crib. He worked so much his back was totally sore. At one point, they all went out to the zoo and nobody stayed behind to help him.

Roxanne waid she felt like she was fat. Dad said "no, it looks like you just put on the freshman 15." Roxanne thought that meant he said she was fat.


I talked to Mom
Mom has been more on his side lately. It's interesting
She says "Roxanne should know that he needs to be treated a little differently"
She says "why does Dad have to make a big vow?"
She says "Dan is more about saying empty words than about doing actions. He cares a lot about social norms. He says 'I'm sorry' a million times a day"
She says "I think Dan is the one who told Roxanne to ask for an apology. And then he was saying 'no, you should not be apologizing about glass cup situation'"


I talked to Moog
Moog says "Dad doesn't know how to express himself in any way other than acts of service"
Moog says that she thinks roxanne is wrong. That she has an unhealthy relationship with food and weight. That's not Dad's fault



I talked to Shari
Shari says "Roxanne just pushed out a baby! Her emotions are on high alert. "
