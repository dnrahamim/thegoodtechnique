1. no more `Payment.destroy_all(key: value)`
instead use `Payment.where(key: value).destroy_all

2. no more ActiveRecord::Base.sanitize
instead use public api https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Sanitization/ClassMethods.html

3. can’t do `errors[:url] = "needs to be a valid URL”`
instead do `errors[:url] << "needs to be a valid URL”`

4. no more getting Grape::Entity keys using `entity.exposures`
instead I did entity.root_exposures.to_a.map {|d| d.attribute}

5. sometimes doctor.practices returns a relation instead of an associaton. what's up with that?

a relationship
is about hammering out
so that you fit together seamlessly
building trust. understanding. loyalty. teamwork

when you start
you are more afraid, confused, detached, out of sync
as your relationship goes
you will move in. closer and closer
but as that happens
you will run into these square peg round hole places
knots
that you need to smooth out
conflicts



the rules
when someone hurts you
you don't hurt them back
because that doesn't really help you
you do what you can to wake them up
enought to convince them to right what was wrong


just think how importatn this is for me as someone who identifies as a prosocial psychopath
i have this strong 50% pragmatism in me. I'm fully willing to use people for what they're worth to me
at least, to see them as means not ends
and my other 50% extreme compassion is not okay with that
but also, we have to live. we have to survive. to move ahead. to take care of ourselves and others
seeing them as objects is a fact of life. it's what we do to help them and ourselves
so we need to do it with precision
how? the rules
leave out the malice. the resentment
recognize the element of fear. hysteria
boil it down to pure logic. to pure positive feeling
recognize what balance feels like. recognize when trust feels right
then. treat people how you will
yes. it means a lot to us
