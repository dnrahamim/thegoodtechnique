Incorporate
---------
You might have some friends and relatives who are difficult to be around. You might be tempted to avoid them outright. But unless they are completely too much to handle, you should try to incorporate them. Stretch your beliefs of who can be incorporated. Hammer them into shape.

Because: you need a family one way or another. The best people to work with are the ones you've already got.
