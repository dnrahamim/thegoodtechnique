---------
Incorporate
---------
You might have some friends and relatives who are difficult to be around. You might be tempted to avoid them outright. But unless they are completely too much to handle, you should try to incorporate them. Stretch your beliefs of who can be incorporated. Hammer them into shape.

Because: you need a family one way or another. The best people to work with are the ones you've already got.


---------
Roles
---------
A family has roles
mother, father, big sister, big brother, little sister, little brother, grandma, grandpa, child, friend, rival, partner, lover, mentor, student
Every role needs to be filled by someone in your life
Filling the role lets you develop your identity and balance your emotions

**Trouble
In a 2-person relationship, you both need to fill 100% of those roles for one another. This is impossible. You can do a valiant job of context switching. But it's exhausting. And never what you really need.
This can lead us to problems. I might want you to simultaneously be my mentor and my lover. But one interferes with the other. So I pick one. Now you're frustrated. You wanted a mentor but are stuck with a lover. This is why we must have other relationships.
