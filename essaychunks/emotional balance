emotional balance
a person has strong emotions
to operate propertly
you need to have emotional balance

when something bad happens to you
you are thrown into a state of alarm
you're off balance

to restore balance
you "express" yourself

what many of us don't realize
is that the alarm persists
long after the bad event is over

and it doesn't go away
it can last your whole life
until you "express" yourself
