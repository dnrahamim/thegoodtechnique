Relationships

What is a Relationship?
A Relationship is the most important thing in our lives
Relationships provide us with
Food
Shelter
Love
Better than anything

Alone
We have trouble providing for our own needs
Together
We expand the pie
And we get 3x as much done

--------------
The Goal of a Relationship
---------------
The Goal of a Relationshp
is to become
Perfect Teammates

When we meet each other
We are not perfect at working together
Our relationship is raw material

Every day we
Build Trust
Loyalty
Understanding
Synchronize

------------------
To be a Teammate
------------------
Means that we identify as one unit
We come to rely on each other
so that our destinies are tied together.
We share our homes, money, time, emotions
with the understanding that we will not be attacked
or abandoned
We do not keep secrets (though we have our privacy)
because we know that two heads are better than one
The attitude is always
love me, love my Shari
if you need to say it, you can say it on front of Shari
if I'm invited, then Shari is coming too

**Say Everything**
As a team. Two heads are better than one.
Whatever is wrong in your life, affects us both.
You tell me what's wrong with you
And together we figure out a solution
And we both benefit

Your emotions are a project for the team to work on. Especially your negative emotions. Negative emotionas which This can be difficult to accept. Whatever makes you feel ashamed, scared, stupid: you tell it to me and we work on it in detail. For example, if you worry you will cheat on me. If you are struggling with an addiction. If you have naughty thoughts about 15-year-olds.


For example. I have a friend who worried her would cheat on his partner. Shari and I asked "did you talk to her about this?" He looked at us like we were crazy. I have another friend who couldn't tell us what her partner did for a living. She wanted to brainstorm ways to secretly sneak out the information.

**Misconceptions**
I have to keep secrets
In our relationship. You might feel that there are things you "can't" tell me.
For example, you might tell your friends "I am afraid I will cheat on him." But you reason that's something you can't tell me.
Not so. This is something you must tell me. That feeling is part of who you are. In particular, it's one that makes you distressed. Both of us are together responsible for your well being and also for mine.

---------
Questions
---------
You might rightly say: how can I comepletely tie myself up with another person? Leave no exit strategy? Isn't that a great way to get fleeced by someone else? To get stuck in a toxic relationship?
You are correct. Trust and loyalty must be earned. In a slow and deliberate process.

----------------
Building a Bond
----------------
We each bring to the table our own unique needs and boundaries. This mixture varies with each relationship.

Together, we will every day work on meeting my needs
and work on meeting yours
Together, we will work on respecting your boundaries
and work on respecting mine

The more needs we meet and boundaries we respect
the more Trust we build up

we also
1. test those needs
2. test those boundaries

This is difficult
Every day we have to learn each others' needs/boundaries
We will communicate to the best of our ability
But it's mostly trial and error

we're going to screw it up
I'm going to forget what you told me
Not notice your cries for help
Or ignore them
Or misprioritize them
Or give you want I think you need

I'm also going to violate your boundaries
Forget them
Misprioritize them

we'll put up with these things for a while
Until we have Conflict

-----------
Conflict
-----------
Conflict is unavoidable
Conflict is one/both of us saying "this isn't working for me"
whatever "this" is

conflict is what makes/breaks relationships
conflict is where we do the serious communicating
and prioritizing
the most important needs
serious boundaries
we communicate in our rawest form
we say "i can't go on like this." we make ourselves clear

it's not easy
when we're distressed
and we need to communicate raw. with big voice and big eyes
we run the risk of hurting each other
that's why the technique of Conflict Resolution is so essential

when its over
we make an agreement
this means that we have a better understanding of our needs
and draw up new boundaries
and by hurting each other minimally
we have more trust


-----------
The Cycle
----------
1. meet their needs
2. test those needs
3. respect their boundaries
4. test those boundaries 
5. have conflict
6. make an agreement
7. repeat

-----------
The Rules
-----------
All of these rules should be acceptable to any psychopath. They are founded on what works. It is just coincidence that they are also compassionate and just.

If I turn out to be too much for you to handle. That's nobody's fault. It just is what it is.

**Volume
Volume is not about attack. It is about providing a wakeup call. Being unmistakable. If I really test out your boundaries. and I cross the line. I don't always know what I'm doing. Sometimes I'm wrapped up in my own crazy emotions. So you need to yell and bare your teeth to show me that it hurts. But the point isn't to hurt me. It's to 1. educate me 2. protect yourself.

**Punishment
Punishment is not about revenge. It is about providing a wakeup call.


----------
Problem
----------
Most of us are not equipped to participate in healthy relationships
1. we have never seen a healthy relationship
2. we are emotionally unbalanced
3. we do not understand how human beings work
4. we do not understand the rules: like discipline or punishment
5. we are negative
6. we have baggage from bad relationships

2. we are emotionally unbalanced
we imagine that anxiety, depression, abuse, are all very obvious. spectacular things like staying in bed for a week or beating someone in the kitchen. not so. we all harbor deep insecurities. fears. they make it hard to live. they make it hard to be in a relationship

3. we don't understand how human beings work
When we fight, we see each other purely as aggressive. We don't realize that there is fear beneath there. If I were to talk to you, you would say "fear? no, she just wants to hurt me"

6. we have baggage from bad relationships
our bad relationships teach us bad habits. they make us insecure and resentful. we bring this toxicity into our relationships

this leaves us with a handicap
to have a fighting chance, we must know what we are up against

---------------
Detail
---------------
Let me paint the fullest picture i can
As soon we begin our relationship
We each begin to hypnotize each other
and we trip. Balls

We are each acting out all of our former relationships on each other
All of our anxieties and traumas
We are deeply insecure
And we project most things we don't understand as fear and negativity

This is an extremely intense experience

loyalty
trust
security
fear
needs
heal traumas
find myself
come to terms with reality


Needs
It's hard for you me to provide for my own needs
Financial. Material. Emotional
I'm only one man

It's much easier with you around
We can do Division of labor. The two of us can lift heavy things

When we're together. I continually tell you what I need
Some subliminal. Some explicit
Things like:
How I need the house arranged so I feel comfortable
How much affection I like
My favorite foods and how I like them prepared


Anxieties
My anxieties are very heavy
I get wrapped up in them
I know that they're not 100% real
But they feel real

It's much easier with you around
I show you what I'm scared of
dogs, clutter, dark, sex
you help me sort out what's real and what's not
you help me to manage my anxieties. okay, let's not hang around dogs

Conflict
I don't fully communicate my anxieties. Maybe I communicated them subliminally. But not explicitly
I communicated them but you didn't get it. You didn't see how serious they were. And you've been walking all over my anxieties.
I project my anxieties onto you. Now you're scared of the dark. Now you're scared of dogs. You object. You don't want my craziness taking over you.

you have a list. two lists
don't do this
don't do that
or this
or that
i need this
i need that
i need some of thiose
place like this
treatment like this
house like this
dog like that
don't do that
don't this


and another one for you
don't do this
don't do that
or this
or that
i need this
i need that
i need some of thiose
place like this
treatment like this
house like this
dog like that
don't do that
don't this


we need to match them up like DNA
how are these lists going to work?




Inevitably. Conflict
show your fears. Represent scaries point of view. Make an agreement. Reset boundairies.
Commitment ot needs/boundaries. loyalty. understanding.
you could hurt me . but you didnt
