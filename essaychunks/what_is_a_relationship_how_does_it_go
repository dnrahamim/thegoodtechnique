Relationship. Being on a Team
Meet someone - develop a bond - set boundaries
During Daily life:
1. respect/support their needs
2. respect/support their boundaries
1. test those needs
2. test those boundaries

Inevitably. Conflict
show your fears. Represent scaries point of view. Make an agreement. Reset boundairies.
Commitment ot needs/boundaries. loyalty. understanding.
you could hurt me . but you didnt

loyalty
trust
security
fear
needs
heal traumas
find myself


Needs
It's hard for you me to provide for my own needs
Financial. Material. Emotional
I'm only one man

It's much easier with you around
We can do Division of labor. The two of us can lift heavy things

When we're together. I continually tell you what I need
Some subliminal. Some explicit
Things like:
How I need the house arranged so I feel comfortable
How much affection I like
My favorite foods and how I like them prepared
