Rehabilitating Adults

Self-expression is part of a person's daily diet
Every day, we accumulate feelings
And every day we have to express those feelings
To other people

If we don't express those feelings
We get emotional constipation
those backed-up feelings
develop into phobias and resentments

Relationships
A relationship is about becoming close
which means learning to understand and trust another person

As two get closer
You run into these inevitable Conflicts.
which bring out your fears. and resentments

these conflicts are the opportunity
to express our deeply constipated feelings
