**Personality**
For humans, personality can be thought of as a natural resource.
In a family, you have a pool of personality from which to draw
and you want complete coverage in that pool

you want mothers, brothers, grandmothers, children, friends
you want to have warriors, teachers, preachers, healers
you want to have available plenty of facial expressions, tones of voice, body language, meters of speech
character attributes like courageous, shy, energetic, wrathful
habits. like brushing teeth. bedtime. eating
obedience. dedication. food preferences.
ideas. points of view. convictions. outside the box thinking

What we do is your copy their personality traits
(most of the time, we copy the really good traits. and leave behind the worst ones)
which helps you to round out your own personality

which makes you better at communicating
to communicate with strangers, loved ones, coworkers
better at express your feelings
(similar but different to communicating)
helps you interpret and relate to your own feelings

In our lives we have all these feelings
Our personality is how those feelings take shape
In our minds and on the surface in our expressions and actions

We all have our own inherent personalities
from babyhood on
