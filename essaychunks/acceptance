life is a cycle
of... event
then acceptance

(right now, i've accumulated a bunch of stuff hapened to me during the week. a lot of it has been strange. i woke up feeling different than the days before. don't feel like malcolm x, or music. who am i today? i'm emotional right now. squeezing out a few tears here and there [shrari also]. today is involving a lot of acceptance)

acceptance? a certain willingness to deal with reality. a certain fearlessness to look reality in the eye
