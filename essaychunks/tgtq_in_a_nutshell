The Good Technique in a Nutshell

When I was a child
I remember moments
When life was a paradise
Times that I was in nature
Or with my family dog

When I became and adult
I found it that I had those moments
of perfect happiness
less and less often

By the time I reached the working world
I had happiness of all kinds
I had love. I had friendship. Adventure
But I had developed this new frustration
Like I was not living the way that
God had intended for me to live

I felt trapped
By my job. By money. By my health insurance and taxes
And I felt certain
That if I could only get rid of these aspects
Of adult lifestyle
I would be happy 

So I decided to rebel
I concluded that I would do my best
To live the way I did when I was a child
the way our ancestors did

So I spent time in nature
With my friends
With my dog 
I quit my job
And got a job that paid less but fulfilled more
I listend to good music
Painted
Took long walks

It was a good experiment
I got so close to the real deal
But even though I did all the right things!
I wasn't happy
I became miserably anxious
And I only realized how miserable I was
After I got hit by a car
And had to start life over

Along the way
I encountered something I hadn't seen as a child
Systematic injustice
Police brutality. Poverty

I developed the feeling
That something is wrong
Not only with our adult lifestyle
But with the world itself
That it is unjust or polluted
And must be purged of evil

So again I decided to rebel
And I resolved to figure out
Who are these evil people
Or this evil force
That's causing so much injustice

And again I came close
But I came up empty handed
And got hit by a car

It is my experience
That I am not alone here
That other people also feel
That they are lost in the world
That life should be more beautiful
More fair. More compassionate
