trauma

physical pain
loss, fights, disappointments
are traumatic

that is, they hurt
very much
for a long time

struck with a trauma
we are filled with noise
so that we can't think straight or act right

we have trouble getting out of bed
lose our temper. lose money

we want to recover as quick as possible
but
we do not sufficiently understand our emotions
we do not know have techniques to cope with them



1. we do not feel the significance of the initial hit
2. aftershocks lasts longer we realize
3. we do not know how to deal with ourselves under the influence of pain

pain fixes itself
and makes itself worse


we carry a cultural feeling
that emotions can be erased by logic
and that behavior can be overriden by willpower

that, following a trauma
we are not the same people we were before

you make sacrifices

this lasts much longer than we realize

you go flying backward
off balance


(critical technique
is about regaining balance
with minimum damage)

the scariness factor







truama
i had a few catacylsms all close to each other
shari screamed at me with angerface at putt putt
a man yelled at me on the railing
and i got molested at the bus stop
i knew they hurt!
i knew it!
really bad
but, my home isn't fully set up to handle the truama
I don't know how to explain what I need to shari
Shari doesn't know how to handle what I try to do
I tried my best. was I not vulnerable enough? communicated enough?
shari is always on the brink of bi gmisery
what do I do?
but they hurt so bad
it's weeks since cape cod
at least a week since the other two events
but they hurt
i'm still sad
I ate a lot of food and I got constipated
i'm recovering. but it sucked
i sacrificed. adjusted my life
could I have adjusted life differently? taken a day off work? stayed at an air bnb?
could I have worked differently? could I be working differently every day?
it sucks
for a long time I didn't get it
i'm still just figuring it out
am I sad now really because of what happened then?
maybe?
is it the weed? or is the weed from it? maybe both




exercise:
I thought back to that day. I imagined screaming huge to let Shari know. It feels like I want to scream huge now. I want to slam the little cup on the table
shari doesn't understand. she doesn't believe me.


it's funny
i hear this music in my head
it's my upbeat organ trio. funky
even though I'm so sad
just like rewrite the stars
I guess thats good
