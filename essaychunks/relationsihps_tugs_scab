when you enter a relationship with someone
you move forward inexorably

to do this
each of you moves toward the other
away from where they used to be
in individual cases
of who gets the left side of the bed
and what we eat for dinner
if we can't move together in this way
we can't be together

these dialy tugs of war
can be scary

because
we enter our relationships
with scabs from previous fights
that have not fully healed
and when you have an unhealed scab
it hurts to move

so tugs of war are scary

when it hurts
we lash out (it's automatic)
and so
what started as a tug of war
becomes a Fight

when we fight
we get cut in new places
and in old places
and if we don't get time to heal
we get more scabs
