Relationships

Preface
For serveral years I was isolated and out of control
I tried everything to regain control
And everything failed
When I hit bottom I was saved by my family
And I realized
Family was what I was missing

Intro
For humans
Our relationships are everything
They represent our fondest and safest memories
Of family dinners and warm fires
They fuel our love songs
Carry us through impossible suffering

Nonetheless
They are extremely difficult to manage
We fight, we hide, we cheat, we break up

Conflict is unavoidable in relationships
Although does not have to be toxic
It often is

A large part of our difficulty with relationships is that we are unprepared for them.
We do not know what to expect. We are surprised and scared by the normal course of events.

This book is largely educational.
It explains what relationships are for.
What is a healthy attitude.
The rules for interacting with another human.
The inevitable milestones and how to handle them.

1. People Need Family
Humans are social animals
Like fish need water
Humans need family

We rely on our family for everything
To develop our peronality
To provide us with food and shelter
To shoulder difficult tasks
To balance our emotions
To protect us

When we feel that we have a close and loving family on our side
Then we have true confidence
And independence
We face our personal challenges
balanced and unafraid

On the other hand
if we are cut off from our families
we are in big trouble
not only do we lose their help
but we rapidly lose our confidence
and emotional balance

we know this fact instinctually
an isolated person
is a desperate person

1.1 Forming a Family
Family is not just blood relation
Family is formed by a bond of loyalty
Which is earned over time

When we begin a relationship with anyone
We begin with mutual distrust
And a rightful fear of abandonment

As we live together
Especially when we overcome hardship
We develop trust
By proving that we will not hurt one another
or abandon one another
Even when the going gets difficult

We also synchronize
And understand
