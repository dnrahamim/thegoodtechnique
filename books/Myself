Rules for a healthy relationship
-------------
1. Your feelings are important.
2. You have no wrong feelings.
3. You can't change how you feel.
4. You deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated.
5. You don't need to tolerate abuse.
6. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
7. If you were hurt, you deserve an apology.
8. It's okay to be apart from each other.
9. We must both have other relationships.
10. It's okay for us to leave each other.


**2. You have no wrong feelings.
Most religion and modern thought believes in the yetzer harah. The wicked inclination. You feel inclined to hurt other people. Cheat. These inclinations aren't evil. They are real needs. That doesn't mean you should actually do the thing you see in your head. But you need to do.. something.

Things to Accept about Yourself:
-----------
Duality
-----------
You simultaneously carry conflicting feelings at once.
You are less like a melting pot and more like a mosaic.
You can slip into feeling happy. Then slip into feeling mad.
You might like rock one minute. And classical the next.

There is a way of being that actually feels right
That's what you're aming for

**Mind Reading
You don't always know how you feel
You can't always explain how you feel
But your feelings do affect you
What you think. How you act


How to Deal in the Boundaries of Daily Life:
------------
Discomfort
------------
When you're at work, it's going to be uncomfortable
So you get used to being uncomfortable
But what you have to not do
is get so used to being uncomfortable that you miss the opportunities to make it better. Stretch. Change positions. Stop binge-eating.
How do you notice?
1. Healthy Social Perspective
2. Little daily tricks
Primarily: Healthy Social Perspective. So that's all i care to talk about


**How do I know what's right and wrong?
The world is too diverse
For us to figure out everything ourselves
We have to rely on the experience/advice of others
How do we know when they are right/wrong?
They tell us
Primarily by transgressing the rules of a healthy relationship
They use pressure
They scream and shriek
Scratch and misdirect eye contact
And generally make it clear what outcome their advice amounts to
