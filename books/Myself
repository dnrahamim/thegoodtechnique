----------
Things a Human Needs to be Able to Do
----------
1. Cry
2. Say how you feel
3. Glare without smiling
4. Endure your own feelings
If you can't do these things, you'll be stuck


-----------
Rules for a healthy relationship
-------------
1. Your feelings are important.
2. You have no wrong feelings.
3. You can't change how you feel.
4. You deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated.
5. You don't need to tolerate abuse.
6. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
7. If you were hurt, you deserve an apology.
8. It's okay to be apart from each other.
9. We must both have other relationships.
10. It's okay for us to leave each other.


**2. You have no wrong feelings.
Most religion and modern thought believes in the yetzer harah. The wicked inclination. You feel inclined to hurt other people. Cheat. These inclinations aren't evil. They are real needs. That doesn't mean you should actually do the thing you see in your head. But you need to do.. something.

Things to Accept about Yourself:
===========
Duality
===========
You simultaneously carry conflicting feelings at once.
You are less like a melting pot and more like a mosaic.
You can slip into feeling happy. Then slip into feeling mad.
You might like rock one minute. And classical the next.

There is a way of being that actually feels right
That's what you're aming for

**Mind Reading
You don't always know how you feel
You can't always explain how you feel
But your feelings do affect you
What you think. How you act


------------
Dealing with Duality
------------
Your job is not to fight against yourself
Though sometimes it is
You can't "win" against yourself. Nor should you try

If you have an overwhelming desire to eat a whole cake
Maybe
Eat a little cake. Then hold back
Go straight to bed
Get the heck out of the house
Speak to another human being
Maybe don't stay at work and ignore it. Leave work. Have a sick day.

Even if some system in your body seems out of control
If they're begging you to do something you shoulnt
Eat a whole cake
Have sex with someone you shouldn't

These are
1. Communcations. They mean something. You need to do creative thinking about what they mean
2. Unstoppable. You can't fight your emotions. Or, you can try. But they'll just come out as the flu. Or as some other crazy emotion. 

Usually our minds are focused on Judgements:
"I'm bad. Other people are bad" (resentments)
Instead of on things that actually help the situation

------------
Psychopathy
------------
You might be disturbed
becauase some large part of your
has no feeling toward other people
and sees them more are objects than living beings

this situation happened to me
around my 25th birthday
when I noticed this part of myself
i became scared. and ashamed

in popular belief
the phsychopathic self
is at odds with our emotional self
the emotional self wants to love, build, grow
and the psychopathis self wants to destroy, abuse, manipulate

this is not the case
these two sides of myself
and of yourself
want the same things
they just have different ways of seeing the world
the psychopathis self causes destruction
when it is sick. our of balance
just like our loving emotions do
when they are sick and out of balance

learn to explore both these sides of yourself
and help them come to agreement
not endless war

------------
Ignoring/Acting on Feelings
------------
There are no unimportant feelings
no bad feelings
no feelings worth repressing

however
we do have difficulty
understand what a feeling "means"

example
I might feel extremely like I miss shari
and angry that she's not spending all day with me
but maybe that's not he whole story
maybe I miss shari
but I just want a serious look in the eyes
before I go back to my life

make sense?
maybe I feel like I really am attracted to a person at work
but really I just want a friend
or maybe I want sex from Shari

------------
How to Know How to Act
------------
Often I have the feelings
that I want to do something
and not knowing how to do it

or, in hindsight
I look back at something I've done
and wonder how I could have done it better

this happens especially
when dealing with other people
disciplining Rain
being short-tempered with Shari
eat a plare of cookies

the thing is
it's not wrong to be short-tempered


**Resentment. Calm Assertive Energy. Geat Love. The Body knows many Things


------------
How to Know How to Act #2: Balance
------------
Knowing how to act is a balancing act
it's about pulling off a move

especially when it comes to Trusting Shari
all your feelings are important
fear is real
drive is real
love is real
you need to walk this thin line
a line that's the intersection of what you know is real
instead of going with the loudest feeling
it's a skill. one you learn over time
but when I tell you to trust
I'm telling you "trust what you know"
trust that thin line

or maybe its
trust because it's all you can do
this is a logical argument. they all are
trust because trust is what you lack
trust because it's hard and you can never do it too much
trust because it doesn't preclude self-defense. or self-preservation
trust because it's your only hope. distrust wont get you anywhere

**How to Deal in the Boundaries of Daily Life:
------------
Discomfort
------------
When you're at work, it's going to be uncomfortable
So you get used to being uncomfortable
But what you have to not do
is get so used to being uncomfortable that you miss the opportunities to make it better. Stretch. Change positions. Stop binge-eating.
How do you notice?
1. Healthy Social Perspective
2. Little daily tricks
Primarily: Healthy Social Perspective. So that's all i care to talk about


**How do I know what's right and wrong?
The world is too diverse
For us to figure out everything ourselves
We have to rely on the experience/advice of others
How do we know when they are right/wrong?
They tell us
Primarily by transgressing the rules of a healthy relationship
They use pressure
They scream and shriek
Scratch and misdirect eye contact
And generally make it clear what outcome their advice amounts to


============
Zen and Platitudes Explained
============
**No use crying over spilled milk
I can't control how I feel
or whether or not i cry
crying for the pure sake of emotion
is good and right. helpful with nothing to change
but our emotions become laden
we're crying for reasons unrelated to milk
worries. anxieties. shames. resentments

all Zen is the Serenity Prayer
come to terms with reality:
remember that it's okay. it was only milk
remember that now it's different. i got yelled at before. i wont get yelled at now

accept what I cannot change:
accept that the milk is never coming back (technique)
if i'm gonna get in trouble, accept that too

courage to change what I can:
clean up the milk

if you meditate through the misery
you notice that the serenity prayer sort of happens on its own

==========
Misc
==========
As a person
you are more sensitive than you think
bright lights and loud noises
grossed out more than you think
have shorter attention than you think
but longer attention for other things
more weird
concerned about the shape of your sandwich
needy in odd ways
don't need other things at all
you do things every day that have gotten into your routine
aht scare and disturb you
for no reason that couldn't be repurposed
especially
resentment

Resentment is a learned behavior

there's a lot we do out of sheer habit
that actually hurts quite a lot
but we don't notice what hurt feels like
or what cuaes it
out if sheer habit
I eat some halva
i only half-like halva
then i get a headache
i hate the headache
but i dont notice what caued it
and really
i the habit to eat the halva
isn't all that strong
sometimes it is very strong
but i never bother to test it
and when i do test it
i figure out it was easy


You do it by having
a respectful attitude
between your different drives/opinions
to determine what reality really looks like
