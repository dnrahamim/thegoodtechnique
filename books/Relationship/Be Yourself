===========
Be Yourself
===========
A relationship in a nutshell:
be yourself

that is
be very attentive
and very demanding
to others
to yourself
for yourelf

a relationship
is about moving closer

<lines of closeness>

the closer we get to each other
the better we synchronize
the better our lives are

the way we get closer
is by
attending to each others needs
respecting each others boundaries
and navigating occasional conflict
in an equal
and reciprocal way

being in a relationship
means simultaneously
taking care of you
and care of me

this situation
faces us with
difficult choices
"how much should I give to you"
"how much should I give to me"

every day
in our relationship
we are faced with
ambiguous
situations

we only have so many
physical
and emotional
resources
we need to spend them wisely

lets use an example
suppose you and I are in wal mart
and I start having a tantrum
yelling
maybe even throwing pretzels

you need to do something
but the question is "what"
should you drag me to the door?
should you just let me rage until i get tired?
should you try to pacify me with jokes and candy?
say understanding comforting things?
use logic on me?
negotiate?

you could deal with me in a soft way
but how soft should

there is such a thing in warfare
as triage
a medic walks through the field
identifying the wounded
and choosing who to save
based on who is most likely to survive
and recover

it is simultaneously a lose-lose
and a win-win scenario
you're always saving someone
but also hurting someone else

in a Relationship with another person
every moment
presents a similar sort of win-win, lose-lose

for example
how do I handle a child having a tantrum?
amd i soft or stern?
if I'm stern, how stern should I be?
if I'm soft, how soft?

these questions are hard
because they require us
to deny our loved ones
something they want or need
to provide them
with something they need even more

back to triage
when it comes to deciding who lives and dies
these decisions are emotionally confusing
and never cut and dry

emotionally
we'd want to save the most hopless cases
but triage has to be practical
I have to skip over peopele who have a chance to survive
for people who have a better chance

so
in the same way
we have to be practical in a relationship
I don't want to be stern
but I don't want to be unwelcome in wal mart
so I might be helping you
by quickly and matter-of-factly
putting my hand over your mouth
and dragging you outside

now, because medical triage is so tricky
there are written rules
based on careful calculations
for how to conduct triage
you do the checklist
good to go

in an everyday relationship
there is no manual

now
many people try to solve the problem
of how to handle social situations
especially in close relationships
using their frontal lobes
which means..
self-help books
and platitudes

"happy wife happy life"
"never let your husband hear you poop"
"spare the rod spoil the child"

but the problem
with any type of prescriptive action in a relationships
is that
it's not "what" you do that counts
it's "how" you do it

you can successfully stop a tantrum
and make the child a more disciplined member of society
by being soft
OR by being stern
by being logical
or by coming up with a clever distraction
by avoiding scenarios that cause tantrums
or by deliberately practicing them for hours
and at the same time
you can use any self-help book on earth
to abuse someone
and stress your relationship

so then
what is the manual for how to act?
if everything is "how"

there is a common thread
that appears in zen buddhism
judaism, christianity
alcoholics anonymous

which involves advice like
let go
be present
don't overthink
give it over to a higher power

there is simultaneously this advice
to "live in reality"
observe without judgement
it is what it is

the two ideas are summarized neatly
in the serenity prayer:
give me the courage to change what i can
to serenity accept with i cant
and the wisdom to know the difference

our problem
is not that we are low on ideas
but that our imaginations are too strong
and we have difficulty identifying what's real and what's not
and that our emotions affect our relatity
so we have difficulty accepting what's real and what's not

and honestly
there's not much we can control
especially in the heat of the moment

however
there is one particular aspect of our emotions
which is the ultimate blinding force
it's the 2-side coin
of great love / resentment

if you have resentment in your heart
if you believe that the child deserves to be hurt just a little
or shoudl toughen up
or if you just take pleasure in dragging them out
or if you're scared
because you think other people in the store will hate you
or say you're a bad parent
or if you're just distracted
and great love isn't what's on your mind
the outcome will be bad
your kid will be less disciplined after the fact
more of a powder keg

that's it
great love


if you want to have a healthy relationship
you have to let go of
resentments
political hatreds
nasty remarks
insensitivities
to anyone
you can't compartmentalize these
