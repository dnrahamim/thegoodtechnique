100% of everything we do or say
has multiple meanings
that's good and right
it lets us get across more information per gesture

for example
suppose you are grieving
you see you ex girlfriend
suddenly, you feel very strong sexual attraction to her
maybe you just want someone to be close to you
or take care of you
the feeling of "sex" might not be the whole story
