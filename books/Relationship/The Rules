------------
Teaching me Rules and Boundaries
------------
* note:
maybe I should make this section just about the rules?
like, let Boundaries be an inference? or its own section for later?
cause I was thinking about rules when I was walking Rain
and it's a lot easier to understand without all the Boundaries part

When we start our relationship
There's a lot of stuff we don't know about each other

1. about how to treat each other
you want to be invited to stuff

2. and how to live together as a team
when I come to our house, we take our shoes off

usually, when you stay over someone's house
(or if you've ever done an air BnB)
they give you an overview of the important rules:
don't use the garbage disposal
unplug the toaster when you're done with it
no noise after 10pm

sometimes, when you start a new relationship
they tell you some important boundaries/needs:
will you please remind me to eat?
i gotta get my sleep or I'll be very cranky
i get jealous so please don't flirt

-------------
Give me Leeway
-------------
The more you control me, the worse I'll learn
The idea is to give me as much slack as possible
While still making sure I don't shoot myself in the foot

-------------
Give me Structure
-------------
You might want me to unlearn some deeply ingrained behavior
This isn't easy for me. My body will go nuts
So help keep me on track. Correct me. Thank you.

-------------
Be Persistent. And Patient
-------------
You might think that just because a rule is super important to you, I'll obey it immediately
Nope. I need to learn. Even if you scream and make bug eyes, I could easily forget

-------------
Breaking the Rules
-------------
Even if we bring up some of the rules upfront
99% of what we learn about each other
is discovered through trial and error

by accident or on purpose
I'm going to break the rules every day
sometimes I'll learn my own lesson
and sometimes you'll need to correct me

------------
I break the Rules
------------
I might
1. Neglect a big responsibility
2. Cross a big boundary
Causing me to hurt my loved ones
or putting them in harm's way
(It is not because I don't care about my loved ones
I care very much. It is nonsense to think I don't)

If I have done this
It is because
1. I am confused about reality
2. I am too emotionally overwhelmed to live in reality

1. The important thing
to sustain our family
is for me to recognize what I did
and make the proper correction

---------------
Correct Me
---------------
I don't fully understand what I did
so you must "show" me
convey to me the precise gravity of the situation
so I can calculate correctly next time

You do this
1. emotionally
2. logically

1. you show me how you "feel" about what I did
primarily, you show me your face
but you also use gestures, tone of voice, etc
to convey your anger, fear, confusion

let your emotions flow
relax your shoulders

these must become embedded in me
so that, the next time i make a calculation
about crossing the street or talking to strangers
I calculate more cautiously

2. you tell me the bare facts
If I leave the door open, the cat will get out
If I run into the street I could die
If I eat too many cookies, I get sick

------------
Be Precise
------------
it is important that you are precise
you might be tempted to overdo it. just to drive the message home
or underdo it. to spare my delicate feelings

please don't

humans are walking bullshit detectors
if your emotions don't fit the situation
or your logic doesn't add up
I will recognize that
and I will ignore most of what you say

don't assume that you can bullshit me so easily
humans are much smarter and more sensitive
than you think

============
Using Emotion for Correctional Purposes
============
Using very strong emotions
like Anger
Shame
Fear
Or even just strong commands or language

are extremely useful
because they make a big impression
and a lasting change

however
for this very reason
they lose their value
if you use them too much

99.9% of situations don't need it

so
you might go your entire life
without seeing a situation
where you need to physically hit your loved one
scream at them all bug-eyed
shame them
or terrify them

-----------
Obstacles
-----------

-------------
Expectations
-------------
[that I don't text my female friends (ooh thats a good one)]

When you're trying to teach me a new rule/need/boundary
remember that your rules aren't obvious to me

to you it might seem plain as day
that I should take my shoes off when i come into the house
but that' snow how I've lived my life up until now

you might expect that, after telling me one time, I'll do it right next time
but that's not how people work

people are slow
it might take me months weeks or months to really change my habits
taking two steps forward and one step back
for really big things, it could take years

-----------
Emotional Baggage
-----------
When I make a violation
you will become emotional
or your own personal reasons
which don't directly relate to the violation

For example
Suppose I come to see you at work
and I'm not dressed appropriately
I might rightly get upset
because I embarassed you

however
you might get extra extremely upset
because you have a bad history with getting ostracized by your peers
in your eyes, a person must never step out of line
that's your anxiety not mine
but when make the violation
you project that anxiety onto me
by screaming extra loud

this emotional overkill
does serve a purpose
it lets me know what kinds of anxieties you have
which are important for me to understand and respect
however
it does confuse the issue

you will try to tell me
as an objective fact
that wearing t-shirts to work
deserves a horrible freakout

this is not true

what you should say is the facts
"i have an anxiety about dressing unprofessional"
if you say so, I can respect that

------------
Resentment
------------
When you are tryint to correct me
if you have even a little resentement
in your words or attitude
I will notice
and I will ignore what you say

Resentment is, by definition
a poisonous an innacurate attitude toward other people
It is when you forget that we are all imperfect and confused
but basically good and doing our best

instead we dehumanize other people
by indulging in a fantasy land
where some people are inherrently bad
did not grow up from innocent children
do not deserve to be understood
or even deserve to be mistreated

everyone has resentments, it's okay
but we should try not to encourage them

resentments come out in any correction
you could say "it makes me embarrased when you dress like a loser"
that's a resentment
you're trying to express a need
it's not coming across

-----------
Detail
------------
I am constantly "testing" boundaries
and "testing" needs
to see how much I can get away with
this is necessary for achieving efficiency

in this process
it is necessary for me to take risks
sometime, to know what's right and wrong
I need to try. and see how it feels

my actions reflect my level of understanding
my emotional balance
my logical abilities

1. perfectly good calculation. insufficient information
in this case, i simply didn't have enough information
I didn't realize that the toaster couldn't stay plugged in
you must provide me with enough information that I can correct my behavior

2. perfectly good information. bad calculation
this shows something about
a. my understanding of the world
b. my ability to make calculations (my emotional compass)

a. my understanding of the world
this is where you provide me with a reality check
you say "no dorian. you cannot lick the big salad fork"
you must provide me with enough information that I can correct my behavior

b. my ability to calculate (my emotional compass)
if my emotional compass is bad, that's a big problem
this is when I made such a mistake
that you can't trust me with that responsibility for a while

----------
Stick to your Own Job
----------
You can't do my job for me
If I can't do my own job, something needs to Change

----------
Punishment
----------
Punishment is a wakeup call
It's not Revenge








The Process of a Relationship

Together
A relationship is about hammering each otehr into shape


a relationship
is about hammering out
so that you fit together seamlessly
building trust. understanding. loyalty. teamwork

when you start
you are more afraid, confused, detached, out of sync
as your relationship goes
you will move in. closer and closer
but as that happens
you will run into these square peg round hole places
knots
that you need to smooth out
conflicts



the rules
when someone hurts you
you don't hurt them back
because that doesn't really help you
you do what you can to wake them up
enought to convince them to right what was wrong


just think how importatn this is for me as someone who identifies as a prosocial psychopath
i have this strong 50% pragmatism in me. I'm fully willing to use people for what they're worth to me
at least, to see them as means not ends
and my other 50% extreme compassion is not okay with that
but also, we have to live. we have to survive. to move ahead. to take care of ourselves and others
seeing them as objects is a fact of life. it's what we do to help them and ourselves
so we need to do it with precision
how? the rules
leave out the malice. the resentment
recognize the element of fear. hysteria
boil it down to pure logic. to pure positive feeling
recognize what balance feels like. recognize when trust feels right
then. treat people how you will
yes. it means a lot to us
