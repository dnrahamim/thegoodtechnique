-------------
Being on a Team
-------------
think of ourselves as parts of a machine
we take care of ourselves
take care of each other
we divide up jobs
and work on projects together
in this way we all do our best

over time
our coordination gets better and smoother
we can do twice the stuff in half the time
which makes our teamship more valuable
and more worth fighting for

if it becomes clear that our partnership is actively hurting us
if odds are good it can be fixed
we do whatever it takes to fix it
if odds are low
we leave

-------------
Communication/Coordination
-------------
being on a team
we each do our job
but we're also working on one big project

we communicate
coordinate
interact

communicate
1. correct each other
2. challenge
3. suggest
4. offer help
5. ask for help
6. give status updates
7. ask questions

interact
1. physically restrain
2. poke
3. encourage each other
4. physically block

at first, it's hard
communication isn't easy to do
it's not easy to understand
(especially since 99% of communication is tone, body language, subtext)
you ask for help, i don't notice
you ask a question. i answer something you didn't ask

but over time
we get used to each other
and learn to work/exist together
1. we learn to speak each others langauge
i learn what you're trying to say
i learn how to express myself in a way you'll understand
2. we get so used to each other, we don't hardly even need to communicate
i already know things you need before you ask for them
i already trust you know what you're doing

benefits of coordination:
everything!
by now, we "get" each other
division of labor
i come home, she understands me
she listens when i like to be listened to. lets me be silent if i want to
i can say how i feel without being embarrased. or scared she'll get mad
she helps me find my glasses. do the taxes
i help her remember to eat. deal with her parents

**What are we Communicating**
When I communicate with you
I am conveying facts
about how I feel / what I think
and about the importance/urgency/certainty I attach to what I communicate

communication should be precise
convey what you actually mean
get it across in a way i will understand
hit the target

communication should be efficient
prioritize
there are infinite things to communicate
but precious little time / energy
say the things that actually matter

communication should be rich
a picture can say a thousand words
say as much as you can in one shot

communication should flow
it should take as little time as possible
(not that you should rush. some thigns just take time to say)

communication should happen just on time
say the words when i need to hear them
don't say anything unless it will help

***Types of Communication***
**Corrections**
when you correct me
your goal is to get across
1. how serious/urgent the issue is at hand
2. how badly out of line my action was

if you offer an alternative
how sure you are of yourself

**Status Update**
sometimes i just give you an update on how things are with me
or with my projects
my job. my friends
and i tell you how serious something is
share what matters to you
share especially if it's something i can help with. 

prioritize
i tell you the most excellent things that went right
and the most serious things that might go wrong

**Ask for Help**
maybe i ask for help
do it when you need it. not after suffering
ask only when you need it. don't overdo
i tell you how urgentely i need help (or advice)
and i also have to communicate what kind of help

**Ask a Question**
