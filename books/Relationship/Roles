We Need Other Relationships
------------
We imagine the nuclear family as 2 parents, 1 or more kids

In a 2-person relationship, you both need to fill 100% of those roles for one another. This is impossible. You can do a valiant job of context switching. But it's exhausting. And never what you really need.
This can lead us to problems. I might want you to simultaneously be my mentor and my lover. But one interferes with the other. So I pick one. Now you're frustrated. You wanted a mentor but are stuck with a lover. This is why we must have other relationships.
