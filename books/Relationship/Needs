Thrive
----------------
A thriving person is much different from a deteriorating person
Phsycially, Mentally, Emotionally
You can tell within 5 seconds of meetig someone

That is because
A Thriving person is not just plain happy
It means you are fully Well and have plenty more Wellness in the tank
You are physically healty and strong.
Your mind is sharp and clear. Your memory is quick.
You are happy! You deal easily with other people.
Basically, you have been getting all of your routine maintenance for while now
And it shows.

A thriving person has many powers.
You are on top of things. You will not casually make big mistakes.
You are balanced. You are free from addictions and crushing anxieties.
You are physically resilient. Simple accidents will not easily injure you.
You are adaptable. You can get thrown into new situations and rise to the top.
You are emotionally resilient. You can experience loss without being paralyzed by grief.
You are ethical. You can interact with angagonistic people without sinking to their level.
You are certain. You can interact with people without forgetting who you are.

What determines whether or not I thrive
Are my various Needs
----------
Needs
----------
My needs are part of my life
Relationship or not. My needs must be fulfilled
The most common needs are Food, Shelter, and Love
And others like
sex, affection, understanding, communication, 
But, like every other human
I have my own infinite particular requirements

I might need my sandwiches cut as triangles instead of rectangles
I need a clean house
I or a 75-degree house
Maybe I want to have a baby
Or see my parents on Thanksgiving
Or spend an entire day in complete silence
I might need a dog in the house
To eat a special diet
To do special physical therapy
To listen to music in the shower
Or I have to take my pills on time
Or avoid bees
Or get plenty of sunlight

We humans are oddly particular
You might think that my needs are silly
Why do you need to take such long showers?
But, when I get what I need
I transform into that thriving person

-----------
Team needs
-----------
On my own, I have to take care of my own needs
In a relationship, 2 things happen
1. I have you to help me take care of my needs
2. I suddenly need new things from you

**1. You Help Me
The more you can help me take care of my needs
The better off your own life will be

Amazingly, you will find
That if you make sure I get to bed on time
And that I take my pills each morning
I transform into a super human
And I start taking out the trash
doing the taxes
listening to your problems
and massaging your feet

**2. I Need You
Being in a relationship means that I need new things from you
sex, affection, communication, understanding, encouragement, space, gifts
same story
if you can find the right balance
of giving me encouragement
and space
I'll start complimenting how you dress
throw you a birthday party
order your favorite dinner
take care of you when youre scared

-------------
Team Thrive!
-------------
When we both Thrive this way
It's great for our relationship
Because we are less prone to fight
More prone to communicate

We kick ass at our jobs and make lots of money
We have energy to go out with our friends
We have the emotional resilience to tolerate alone time

Needs are both a big-picture thing
and a daily thing

===========
Daily lives
===========
Every day, we
1. discover our needs
2. express our needs
3. provide for our needs
4. test our needs

Becoming an expert at your needs
enables me to finesee some parts of our daily lives
If I'm really hungry
I might get hangry
You might wonder why i'm so angry
But once you get used to my needs
You'll know that you should just find me a sandwich

--------------
The Balancing Act
--------------
-----------
Priorities
-----------
We each have 10,000 needs. Some big some small
We can't assess each one immediately

I might really hate my job
But the two of us need food and shelter
So we save it for later (expectations. misconceptions)

It is important to remember
That Needs, simultaneously
Don't go Away
and Change over Time

If you really need something. It's like hunger. Or a throbbing pain.
You need to handle it
But even if you can't handle it right now
You keep an eye on it
And see how it progresses
You never bury it, forget it, or suck it up

-----------------
Technique: Creativity
-----------------
Even when we prioritize needs
We also get Creative
I might not like my job
But there are 1,000 ways to fix that beyond quitting
I could... talk to my boss
Bring my toys from home
Ask to go to a new department
Ask for a raise
Find a new job
Work shorter hours. Or different days
Get more alone time at home
Eat better lunch
Vent about it when I get home

There's a lot for you to do as my teammate here
To encourage me

We're always realistic about priorities
But we never act like needs don't exist
There's always something to be done.

---------------
Technique: Acceptance
---------------
Even though there's always something to be done
There isn't always something to be done this second
Sometimes, I don't like my job right now. And that's how it is for the near future
What you do is:
the only way out isin
sigh
accept our fate
can you accept it?
imagine the worst case scenario
imagine you work there the rest of your life
but you have a happy family and all that
can you do it?


--------------
Clashing Needs
--------------
And often, our needs will clash!

At the very same second
You'll be having a panic attack
And I have a headache
you need to play your music
and I want peace and quiet




You're going to have to learn to feel just how big yours is
relative to mine

When yours is bigger than mine
You'll have to stand up for yours. Handle yours first
Or when mine is bigger than yours
Step back. And handle mine first



-------------
Reality
-------------
The reality is, when we each start our realationship
1. We don't know what all our needs are
2. We probably aren't each Thriving

----------------
1. We don't know what all our needs are
----------------
Needs aren't obvious. Just because they're your own needs doesn't mean you know what they are
Maybe you're lactose intolerant. Doesn't mean you realize that's what's happening when you eat pizza.
Maybe you're very sensitive. Doesn't mean you realize it when I call you stupid.

Even if I know all of my needs doesn't mean I know how to communicate them.
Maybe I know I'm sensitive. But you want me to be this macho guy (expectations). And I'm embarrased to tell you I'm not always.
Maybe I have a sexual kink. I don't know how to say so.

Even then. This is a new relationship. I'm going to have unique needs pertaining to YOU
I'm going to need you to be more quiet. Or more loud
Or help me more often. Or leave me alone.

My needs are going to change. With the day, month, season, year.
Some days I wake up sensitive. Some days I'm a big aggressive joker.
One year I'm hyper-organized. But next year I'm a different person.

-------------
Figure Our My Needs Please
-------------
A lot of our relationship will be spent figuring out each others needs
Often talking about them. And making explicit agreements

For example, I might get wait 30 minutes every morning for the bus
This is a secret need!
If you go online, and find me a better bus
I can get home sooner
Less tired. More happy. Ready to be with our family.

---------------
2. We probably aren't each Thriving
---------------
This is a big one
When people aren't totally Thriving, we're basically fine
But, we drop the ball
The less we are already thriving, the more we drop the ball
The scale is like this
Thriving
Haning on
Deteriorating

-----------
Deteriorating
-----------
A Deteriorating person is not just plain sad
It means you are Unwell and have plenty more Unwellness in the tank
You are physically weak. Often prone to getting sick.
Your mind is cloudy. Your memory is slow.
You are sad! You have conflict with other people.
Basically, you have not been getting all of your routine maintenance for a while now
And it shows.

A Deteriorating person is overwhelmed.
You are not on top of things. You might casually make big mistakes.
You are unbalanced. You labor under addictions and crushing anxieties.
You are physically flimsy. Simple accidents may easily injure you.
You are rigid. You are floored by even small changes in routine.
You are emotionally flimsy. You cannot experience loss without being paralyzed by grief.
You are ethically unsound. You angagonistic people without sinking to their level.
You are unconstant. You act like whoever you are around for better or for worse.

-----------
Team Hanging On!
-----------
When we meet each other
We probablly aren't full-on deteriorating
But we're probably not thriving superheroes either
Chances are, we're just hanging on
Clearly this has implications for
1. Our daily lives
2. Our relationship (which is related)

1. Our daily lives
I might leave the oven on, then leave the house.
Or forget to feed the cat.
Or get into a fight with my boss.
Or cheat on our taxes.
Or get sick and miss lots of work
Or get too depressed to leave bed
Or lose my mind when my relative dies

2. Our relationship.
I might get short-tempered.
Get resentful.
Get defensive.
Get overly sensitive.
Fail to honor an agreement.
Fail to take care of your needs.
Call you names.
Cheat on you.

-------------
This Changes the Situation
-------------
Remember
Things are already kindof tricky
You need to to figure out what I need
To remember it
To put in the energy to provide me with it
But

1. You are going to be low on energy/brainpower/understanding
2. I am going to be extra bad at saying how I feel

1. You are going to be low on energy/brainpower/understanding
How can you remember what I need when you're overwhelmed by your own problems?
When I come home and complain about my job? How are you going to summon the energy to care?
For one thing, you'll have to prioritize


---------------
Common Needs
---------------
**Express How you Feel
One of the most useful things about a relationship
Is that you get to express how you feel
which helps us to accepts how we feel

Human beings are Communication Machines
we are constanly Expressing ourselves
with body language
subtext
double-meanings
gestures
tone of voice
facial expressions
and straighforward language

for some reason
we absolutely need to feel understood

**Expression of Trauama
Everyone expreiences trauma
Trauma is any serious pain or fear
The antidote to Trauma is expression

When something bad happens
say, you get attacked by a dog
you immediately go
and say what happened to a trusted loved one
and they listen
and uinderstand
and tell you it's okay now. you're safe again
that lets you come to terms with it
and release it
so you can move on with your life

However
many of us
in our relationships
have not felt safe enough or close enough
to our loved ones
to say exactly how we feel

so. bad things have happened
that we've kept inside
and they continue to affect us to this day

part of my job as your partner
is to listen to how you feel
so that
when you feel close enough and safe enough
you'll say how you feel
and slowly release the pressure inside
and accept what happened
