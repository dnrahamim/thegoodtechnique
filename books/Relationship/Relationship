What is a Relationship?
A Relationship is the most important thing in our lives
Relationships provide us with
Food
Shelter
Love
Better than anything

Alone
We have trouble providing for our own needs
Together
We expand the pie
And we get 3x as much done

--------------
The Goal of a Relationship
---------------
The Goal of a Relationshp
is to become
Perfect Teammates

When we meet each other
We are not perfect at working together
Our relationship is raw material

Every day we
Build Trust
Loyalty
Understanding
Synchronize

------------------
To be a Teammate
------------------
Means that we identify as one unit
We come to rely on each other
so that our destinies are tied together.
We share our homes, money, time, emotions
with the understanding that we will not be attacked
or abandoned
We do not keep secrets (though we have our privacy)
because we know that two heads are better than one
The attitude is always
love me, love my Shari
if you need to say it, you can say it on front of Shari
if I'm invited, then Shari is coming too


**Healthy Team
Trust each other
Rely on each other
Share important information
Equals
Provide for each other
Protect each other


**Unhealthy team
Afraid of each other
Exclude each other
Keep important secrets
Competetion for status
Neglect
Abuse

The way to become healthy teammates with another person is to treat them as your healthy teammate.
*Misconception: You might say "well my partner doesn't want to have a healthy relationship. I try to be nice but they aren't nice to me. So I won't be nice either." This is incorrect.
The correct move is to say "hey, we're teammates and you need to care about my feelings because I care about yours." You treat them exactly as if you both want to be good teammates and they are just confused. And in this way you hammer them into shape.


**Say Everything**
As a team. Two heads are better than one.
Whatever is wrong in your life, affects us both.
You tell me what's wrong with you
And together we figure out a solution
And we both benefit

Your emotions are a project for the team to work on. Especially your negative emotions. Negative emotionas which This can be difficult to accept. Whatever makes you feel ashamed, scared, stupid: you tell it to me and we work on it in detail. For example, if you worry you will cheat on me. If you are struggling with an addiction. If you have naughty thoughts about 15-year-olds.

For example. I have a friend who worried her would cheat on his partner. Shari and I asked "did you talk to her about this?" He looked at us like we were crazy. I have another friend who couldn't tell us what her partner did for a living. She wanted to brainstorm ways to secretly sneak out the information.

**Misconceptions**
I have to keep secrets
In our relationship. You might feel that there are things you "can't" tell me.
For example, you might tell your friends "I am afraid I will cheat on him." But you reason that's something you can't tell me.
Not so. This is something you must tell me. That feeling is part of who you are. In particular, it's one that makes you distressed. Both of us are together responsible for your well being and also for mine.

Martyrdom
I need to sacrifice myself for my family. 

---------
Questions
---------
You might rightly say: how can I comepletely tie myself up with another person? Leave no exit strategy? Isn't that a great way to get fleeced by someone else? To get stuck in a toxic relationship?
You are correct. Trust and loyalty must be earned. In a slow and deliberate process.

----------------
Building a Bond
----------------
We each bring to the table our own unique needs and boundaries. This mixture varies with each relationship.

Together, we will every day work on meeting my needs
and work on meeting yours
Together, we will work on respecting your boundaries
and work on respecting mine

The more needs we meet and boundaries we respect
the more Trust we build up

we also
1. test those needs
2. test those boundaries

This is difficult
Every day we have to learn each others' needs/boundaries
We will communicate to the best of our ability
But it's mostly trial and error

we're going to screw it up
I'm going to forget what you told me
Not notice your cries for help
Or ignore them
Or misprioritize them
Or give you want I think you need

I'm also going to violate your boundaries
Forget them
Misprioritize them

we'll put up with these things for a while
Until we have Conflict

-----------
Incorporate
-----------
As soon as our relationships starts
We begin to
Incorporate each other

There are many adjustments that we each need to make
to be suitable for each other's lives

You learn to Communicate with me
and Understand my unique language
You learn my Quirks and Habits
such as my sleep schedule. or my love of sandwiches cut into triangles
You'll learn what my Boundaries are
and then learn to Respect them
You'll  learn what my Needs are
and then learn to Provide for them
We will build Trust
and develop Loyalty
And we will Synchronize our most basic feelings
so that you take on my Fears, Hopes, Beliefs
and I take on yours

This is a very sudden and drastic change
Suddenly you have
New Responsibilities
Demands
Desires
Challenges
And Feelings
A new relationship can make you feel like a different person
Which can be a very strong and (sometimes scary) Trip

-----------
Conflict
-----------
Conflict is unavoidable
Conflict is one/both of us saying "this isn't working for me"
whatever "this" is

conflict is what makes/breaks relationships
conflict is where we do the serious communicating
and prioritizing
the most important needs
serious boundaries
we communicate in our rawest form
we say "i can't go on like this." we make ourselves clear

it's not easy
when we're distressed
and we need to communicate raw. with big voice and big eyes
we run the risk of hurting each other
that's why the technique of Conflict Resolution is so essential

when its over
we make an agreement
this means that we have a better understanding of our needs
and draw up new boundaries
and by hurting each other minimally
we have more trust



-------------
Synchronize Feelings
-------------
Every day of our relationship
We synchronize our feelings

This means that I gain your
Habits
Manner of speech
Emotions
Fears
Hopes
Resentments
Beliefs
My identity starts to meld with yours. This is an uncomfortable feeling of not knowing where my desires start and where yours end.
However
This process can be lots of fun
and fascinating

An easy example is music
But I play Country and Pop all day
After a while, your playlsit has a bunch of Country and Pop

Or
I'm always looking at baby pictures on instagram
Suddenly you find that you want children

These feelings aren't artificial
They are real feelings that have always been inside you
which are "brought out" by my presence in your life

One of the values of synchronizing our feelings
is that we better understand each others' needs

You get very scared of loud noises
every time I slam the cabinet, you jump and yelp
over time, I get sometimes get scared of loud noises too
so if you ask me
"please don't slam the cabinet"
I will be willing and able to understand

but we don't just get each other's fears
we also gain each others' strengths

you might be extremely organized
just by hanging around you
I learn to put all my appointments in my calendar

Over time these feelings get deep and huge
if I have depression. And I'm always sad and lethargic
You might go to work
and find that you're sad and lethargic too
or the opposite - agitated and jittery

Do not reject even negative feelings
they are part of what you sign up for in a Relationship
They are how you share the Emotional Burden

You are getting a manageable portion of my weak feelings
Use your own personal techniques to help me deal with it
Talk to your coworkers
Take deep breaths
Do some sit-ups

---------
Causes for Conflict
---------
Synchronizing our feelings can feel like an invasion
especially of Fears and Resentments
I don't want to be afraid of loud noises
and every time you jump and look terrified, I might get mad
"What's the big deal!? It's just a cabinet!"

Synchronization is inevitable
you can't force me to keep my fears hidden away
I deserve to say how I feel

You might think that you're doig all the emotional heavy lifting
"You're afraid of everything and I have to be strong"
This is not so

Relationships are Reciprocal
Every time you comprensate for a weakness of mine
I compensate for one of yours
maybe its your argumentative personality or poor focus
Even if you don't know outright how I am helping you
Trust that I am

-----------
The Cycle
----------
1. meet their needs
2. test those needs
3. respect their boundaries
4. test those boundaries 
5. have conflict
6. make an agreement
7. repeat

-----------
The Rules
-----------
All of these rules should be acceptable to any psychopath. They are founded on what works. It is just coincidence that they are also compassionate and just.

If I turn out to be too much for you to handle. That's nobody's fault. It just is what it is.

**Volume
Volume is not about attack. It is about providing a wakeup call. Being unmistakable. If I really test out your boundaries. and I cross the line. I don't always know what I'm doing. Sometimes I'm wrapped up in my own crazy emotions. So you need to yell and bare your teeth to show me that it hurts. But the point isn't to hurt me. It's to 1. educate me 2. protect yourself.

**Punishment
Punishment is not about revenge. It is about providing a wakeup call.

**Boundaries
You might think just because soemone is doesn't something you don't want, they're doing the "wrong" thing. Not so. These need to be treated differently. This conflation causes trouble.


----------
Problem
----------
Most of us are not equipped to participate in healthy relationships
1. we have never seen a healthy relationship
2. we are emotionally unbalanced
3. we do not understand how human beings work
4. we do not understand the rules: like discipline or punishment
5. we are negative
6. we have baggage from bad relationships

2. we are emotionally unbalanced
we imagine that anxiety, depression, abuse, are all very obvious. spectacular things like staying in bed for a week or beating someone in the kitchen. not so. we all harbor deep insecurities. fears. they make it hard to live. they make it hard to be in a relationship

3. we don't understand how human beings work
When we fight, we see each other purely as aggressive. We don't realize that there is fear beneath there. If I were to talk to you, you would say "fear? no, she just wants to hurt me"

6. we have baggage from bad relationships
our bad relationships teach us bad habits. they make us insecure and resentful. we bring this toxicity into our relationships

this leaves us with a handicap
to have a fighting chance, we must know what we are up against


-----------
Rules for a healthy relationship
-------------
1. Your feelings are important.
2. You have no wrong feelings.
3. You can't change how you feel.
4. You deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated.
5. You don't need to tolerate abuse.
6. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
7. If you were hurt, you deserve an apology.
8. It's okay to be apart from each other.
9. We must both have other relationships.
10. It's okay for us to leave each other.


-------------
Expectations
-------------
We start with expectations
Fully 50% of them will have to change
maybe you have to wait
maybe you have to give them up completely
maybe you only get them once per day
maybe our relationship is unlike anything you've imagined
they are painful to let go of
we will resist


=================
Needs
=================
I'm going to figure out my needs slowly
They will.. change

---------------
Common Needs
---------------
**Express How you Feel
One of the most useful things about a relationship
Is that you get to express how you feel
which helps us to accepts how we feel

Human beings are Communication Machines
we are constanly Expressing ourselves
with body language
subtext
double-meanings
gestures
tone of voice
facial expressions
and straighforward language

for some reason
we absolutely need to feel understood

**Expression of Trauama
Everyone expreiences trauma
Trauma is any serious pain or fear
The antidote to Trauma is expression

When something bad happens
say, you get attacked by a dog
you immediately go
and say what happened to a trusted loved one
and they listen
and uinderstand
and tell you it's okay now. you're safe again
that lets you come to terms with it
and release it
so you can move on with your life

However
many of us
in our relationships
have not felt safe enough or close enough
to our loved ones
to say exactly how we feel

so. bad things have happened
that we've kept inside
and they continue to affect us to this day

part of my job as your partner
is to listen to how you feel
so that
when you feel close enough and safe enough
you'll say how you feel
and slowly release the pressure inside
and accept what happened

=================
Boundaries
=================
Boundaries are the way that you want to be treated
By family, strangers, your job, or anything

When your boundaries are respected
you thrive
if they are not respected
your don't thrive

In our relationship
it is good and healthy
to set up boundaries between each other

Your boundaries tell me
how you want to be treated
it is my job to respect your boundaries
as we both learn to live by them
We grow closer
feel safer
and interact more easily

boundaries are not set in stone
every day
as we interact
and change as people
we set new boundaries
and adjust old ones

boundaries are a push/pull process
often your boundaries mean
that I have to change my behavior
which is hard for me

so every day
i test your boundaries
i put my toe just across the line
and see what happens

the process
is good and right
it helps you
to see where you overcompensate
so that
you can live your life
with more freedom

--------------
Figure out your boundaries
--------------
This process can take a long time

For one thing, we have to figure out what our boundaries are
Often, you don't know that you have a boundary
Until I cross it
Even then
You might not notice that you feel bad
Or be able to explain what you want to change

but
beneath the surface
you are building up a feeling

pay attention to little feelings
if necessary, write them down

---------
Communicate
---------
**Say how you feel
You might be worried to say you have a boundary
you might be ashamed to say it
for example, if you have a kink outside the beaten path
or a mental handicap

however, you must be honest
teammate must be on the same page
remind yourself that you have no wrong feelings

**I try to Understand
I may not understand because
Initially
I will project my boundaries onto you
I will assume
That you like what i like
and don't what I don't

when you lay down a boundary
i will have difficulty accepting it
it it is one
which i don't personally feel

part of my accepting your boundaries
is also accepting
that you and I are different

------------
Obstacles
-----------
**Resistance
When you set your boundaries
I will resist
often your boundaries mean
that I have to change my behavior
which is hard for me

Remember that your feelings are important.
You have no wrong feelings.
You deserve to be treated how you want to be treated.


**Slow Adjustment
You're going to want me to change my behavior orvernight
Or to get everything perfect
But I can't do that

All I can do is try my best
And prioritize

==============
General Obstacles
==============
------------
Unhealed Trauma
------------
Unhealed trauma is perhaps the biggest obstacle in a relationship
Because it makes it very difficult
to trust
to communicate
to know your own needs
to see/listen to/perceieve my needs

it has counterproductive effects
makes you likely to
attack
cheat
run away

**Personality
when something bad happens
you're supposed to say it to a close loved one
if you didn't
then you live with it
and eventually compensate for it
this can affect your personality

if you were sensitive once
and someone broke your heart
you might start to act tough
or act confident and suave
or act like a jerk

the problem now is, you're lopsided
and you've forgotten
that you aren't actually so tough. or a jerk

this personality problem


------------
Expectations

**Detail
Let me paint the fullest picture i can
As soon we begin our relationship
We each begin to hypnotize each other
and we trip. Balls

We are each acting out all of our former relationships on each other
All of our anxieties and traumas
We are deeply insecure
And we project most things we don't understand as fear and negativity

This is an extremely intense experience

loyalty
trust
security
fear
needs
heal traumas
find myself
come to terms with reality


Needs
It's hard for you me to provide for my own needs
Financial. Material. Emotional
I'm only one man

It's much easier with you around
We can do Division of labor. The two of us can lift heavy things

When we're together. I continually tell you what I need
Some subliminal. Some explicit
Things like:
How I need the house arranged so I feel comfortable
How much affection I like
My favorite foods and how I like them prepared


Anxieties
My anxieties are very heavy
I get wrapped up in them
I know that they're not 100% real
But they feel real

It's much easier with you around
I show you what I'm scared of
dogs, clutter, dark, sex
you help me sort out what's real and what's not
you help me to manage my anxieties. okay, let's not hang around dogs

Conflict
I don't fully communicate my anxieties. Maybe I communicated them subliminally. But not explicitly
I communicated them but you didn't get it. You didn't see how serious they were. And you've been walking all over my anxieties.
I project my anxieties onto you. Now you're scared of the dark. Now you're scared of dogs. You object. You don't want my craziness taking over you.

you have a list. two lists
don't do this
don't do that
or this
or that
i need this
i need that
i need some of thiose
place like this
treatment like this
house like this
dog like that
don't do that
don't this


and another one for you
don't do this
don't do that
or this
or that
i need this
i need that
i need some of thiose
place like this
treatment like this
house like this
dog like that
don't do that
don't this


we need to match them up like DNA
how are these lists going to work?

Inevitably. Conflict
show your fears. Represent scaries point of view. Make an agreement. Reset boundairies.
Commitment ot needs/boundaries. loyalty. understanding.
you could hurt me . but you didnt


I've only got limited resources

The
The good news is that, in figuring out what to prrioritize, we realize that certain things weren't as important as we though. We can get a lot of mileage by getting the big priorities.
