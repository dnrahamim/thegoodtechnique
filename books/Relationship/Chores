Chores
==========
50% of everything
is chores and jobs
feed the baby
do the dishes
walk the dog

**Okay, I had intended for this to be here
but this is really an emotional trip story
but let's leave it here for now

-----------
Tripping
-----------
Let's say I'm sad
You'll often find
that suddenly you have a lot of positive energy
And if, normally I take out the dog in the morning
you take her out no problem

if normally you're nervous
I'm scared of a ghost
even if you're scared of ghosts!
you'll say "don't worry baby. there's no ghost"

this is weird enough to flip-flop
you might come right back and say
... but is there really a ghost?
I'll say "don't worry baby. there's no ghost"
