============
What is a Human Being
============

--------------
Social
--------------
we hate to be lonely
we crave to express ourselves
we need for other people to "get" us
we wanted to be "liked" by the crowd
and loved by a few close people

--------------
Family Oriented
--------------
much like dogs
We are designed to live in large Families
we evolved in tribes of 20-30 people
not only do we need to be liked by the crowd
it is absolutely necessary we have a few
very close relationships
especialy with strong dependable people
where we can say exactly how we feel
with very little tension, resentment
or fear of abandonment

--------------
Extremely Sensitive
--------------
I notice the tiniest details
of facial expression, tone of voice, gesture
sharp sounds, bright lights, stong smells

when I get hurt emotionaly
it cuts me very deep
and stays with me for a long time

--------------
Extremely Numb
--------------

--------------
Changes Slowly
--------------
I can learn certain things very rapidly
such as little tricks. like juggling
or math or music

but when it comes to changing myself


--------------
Balance and Strength
--------------
A Strong/Balanced person
is completely different
from a Weak/Unbalanced person

it takes a longtime to get strong and balanced
and when you are
suddenly, your options/motivations are completely different
