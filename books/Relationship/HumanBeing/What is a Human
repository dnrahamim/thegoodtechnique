============
What is a Human Being
============

--------------
Social
--------------
we hate to be lonely
we crave to express ourselves
we need for other people to "get" us
we wanted to be "liked" by the crowd
and loved by a few close people

--------------
Family Oriented
--------------
much like dogs
We are designed to live in large Families
we evolved in tribes of 20-30 people
not only do we need to be liked by the crowd
it is absolutely necessary we have a few
very close relationships
especialy with strong dependable people
where we can say exactly how we feel
with very little tension, resentment
or fear of abandonment

--------------
Extremely Sensitive
--------------
I notice the tiniest details
of facial expression, tone of voice, gesture
sharp sounds, bright lights, stong smells

when I get hurt emotionaly
it cuts me very deep
and stays with me for a long time

--------------
Great at Ignoring Things
--------------
Despite how sensitive we are
we can easily ignore hugely important details
right under our noses

you can spell it out for me
in 100 ways
and I'll still not understand
and I'll still not notice

I'm also great at dissociating
if I'm in pain
or intense fear

--------------
Change. And Cycle
--------------
Today might feel completely different from yesterday
Or I feel the same all week. But suddenly very anxious when the warm weather hits.
Felt crazy after eating a big chocolate bar. Now back to normal.
Very energetic at work. Very tired at home
Way I feel at age 30. Totally different from when I was a kid
But maybe sometimes it comes back.

--------------
Changes Slowly
--------------
I can learn certain things very rapidly
such as little tricks. like juggling
or math or music

but when it comes to changing myself

--------------
Powerful Imagination
--------------
Sometimes this gets us into trouble
When we can't tell the differece
between imagination and reality

--------------
Copy Each Other
--------------
We can't help it
we copy each other's mannerisms
we absorb each others' emotions

--------------
Calculate within a Box
--------------
As soon as my friend says
"yea you can stay with me for a month"
I suddenly start coming up with ways to make it happen
that weren't magically coming to me before

--------------
Think Everything is About Us
--------------
I looked at my coworker in the hall
She had a sour face on
Because of me? Maybe. But probably not
She has her own feelings. And life

--------------
Defensive Porcupines
--------------
We're so sensitive
that we need to protect our sensitive feelings
so, if we sense someone might be attacking us
we strike first!
often really doing an overkill
to end the attack before it starts

--------------
Love Characters
--------------
We love fictional characters
And we portray characters in our daily lives
this is good and right
It's good for us to sometimes "act" like a typical "guy"
or a typical "girl"
or like a big baby
or like a touch adult
or to act all cooland nonchalant
or even to ask like a jerk
it's good and right to copy our friends and family
and to copy characters from movies and books

--------------
Duality
--------------
Has mixed feelings 100% of the time

--------------
Develops Balance and Strength
--------------
A Strong/Balanced person
is completely different
from a Weak/Unbalanced person

it takes a longtime to get strong and balanced
and when you are
suddenly, your options/motivations are completely different
