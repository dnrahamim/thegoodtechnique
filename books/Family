Self-Esteem

Self-help material is very valuable. I have personally learned a great deal about myself, my body, and the world around me. However, self-help is limited.
Even with the most brilliant self-help program, even if you learn everything there is to know about confidence, physical fitness, mediation, or addiction. There is a limit to how well you can actually put your new skills into practice. Or how many years of your life you can keep it up.

I know this personally.
I studied how to get very physically fit
I studied how to eat healthy
And how to overcome anxiety

And I succeeded. For a while.
But my life always followed the same cycle.
I would do well for a few months. Or a year. Then regress.

This is because, no matter how much I knew, I always had to balance what I was doing. Dorian was the bottom line.

I would study how to get very physically fit. But then I would overdo it. And end up with very achey muscles and joints. I would try to stretch. And overdo that too. End up with less flexibility than before. Then I would rest. But I would lie in bed and get stiff.

Clearly I had anxiety. So I would meditate. That would help. But sometimes I would get anxious if the meditating didn't work. Some nights I wouldn't want to do it, but I would force myself to. Other times I would drive to a calm beach and take deep breaths. And get miserable that I didn't feel any better.

I knew that food was involved in anxiety. So I tried to eat right. I eliminated all sugar. But I continued to occasionally eat dairy (I'm lactose intolerant). Then I ate straight-up raw food. But I ended eating weird stuff like the peel of a mango or the seeds of an apple. I ended up with really bad food poisoning. I had an abusive girlfriend who pressured me to ignore the pain. I ended up eating lots of cheese and spicy food. Then I said "no more! I'll go on a juice fast." I did that for 2 weeks straight. I got skeletally skinny. So I said, fuck it, I'm just going to eat the same as my friends. So I ate big burritos and hot sauce. I ended up with really bad stomach aches.

I see the exact same thing in my friends and family. Shari was such a lover of positivity, peace, trusting the universe. That is, until she got mad. Then she'd scream at me and say mean things.

Haven't you ever met a very religious person? Who follows all the tenets of their religion down to the detail. But they have some glaring personality flaws. They aren't very nice to other people. Or they're racist against some group.

**Getting Help
Clearly I needed help. So I sought out help.

I went to different therapists for my mental illness. But I got some bad therapists who didn't listen to me. And when I found good therapists, I resisted them too. They told me stuff I already knew. All I really wanted to do was call someone when I got scared.

I saw physical therapists and chiropractors for my joints and back. They told me I was fine. But why did I feel bad? They said it would help my muscles if I exercised. I said "how much should I exercise?" They said "not too much, not too little." How much is that? What I really needed was live-in person to do my exercise with me.

I went to doctors and gastroenterologists for my digestion. They said "you're fine." But why did I feel bad? They said I should eat what feels right? But what feels right? They said I should eat soft food. What kind of food is soft? Is peanut butter soft? I should eat small meals. How much is small? A cup? 2 cups? How much should I eat? Not too much, not too little. How many times a day? You know I binge-eat honey right?

Finding Balance
------------
The point is this: no matter what advice I get. No matter what expert I have in my life. The actual decision of what to do comes down to me. And every single decision in my day amounts to something that can change the rest of my life.

My friend Matt and I were walking down the street. We trained Parkour, so we had spent all summer doing huge complex techniques. As a goof, he jumped up on a bench while looking at his phone. He slipped and busted his knee. His knee is still busted to this day. And it affects his ability to work!

I drunkenly jumped over a table. Split-second decision. Split my collar bone into 3 pieces.

I was feelings great in terms of digestion. I ate a whole bag of dates. Plugged myself way up.
I was feeling great again. Ate a whole box of cheerios at once. Plugged myself way up.

You must have balance. You can't get away without it. The question is where does balance come from?
I tried everything to find balance.
Okay I'll meditate. I'll do yoga. I'll think positive thoughts. I'll take deep breaths.
But even that stuff can get unbalanced! I didn't meditate enough or too much. I tried to force the positive thoughts. I'd get mad at myself if I skipped it. I'd do it for 2 hours and still couldn't sleep.
It's like sticking my finger in the dam, suddenly a new leak pops up. Every time I band-aid one leak, a new one springs out.

So where does balance come from?

Family! Fool!

==========
Rules for Life
==========
Family is everything

---------
Incorporate
---------
You might have some friends and relatives who are difficult to be around. You might be tempted to avoid them outright. But unless they are completely too much to handle, you should try to incorporate them. Stretch your beliefs of who can be incorporated. Hammer them into shape.

Because: you need a family one way or another. The best people to work with are the ones you've already got.


---------
Roles
---------
A family has roles
mother, father, big sister, big brother, little sister, little brother, grandma, grandpa, child, friend, rival, partner, lover, mentor, student
Every role needs to be filled by someone in your life
Filling the role lets you develop your identity and balance your emotions

**Trouble
In a 2-person relationship, you both need to fill 100% of those roles for one another. This is impossible. You can do a valiant job of context switching. But it's exhausting. And never what you really need.
This can lead us to problems. I might want you to simultaneously be my mentor and my lover. But one interferes with the other. So I pick one. Now you're frustrated. You wanted a mentor but are stuck with a lover. This is why we must have other relationships.
