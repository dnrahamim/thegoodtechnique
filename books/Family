Self-Esteem

Self-help material is very valuable. I have personally learned a great deal about myself, my body, and the world around me. However, self-help is limited.
Even with the most brilliant self-help program, even if you learn everything there is to know about confidence, physical fitness, mediation, or addiction. There is a limit to how well you can actually put your new skills into practice. Or how many years of your life you can keep it up.

I know this personally.
I studied how to get very physically fit
I studied how to eat healthy
And how to overcome anxiety

And I succeeded. For a while.
But my life always followed the same cycle.
I would do well for a few months. Or a year. Then regress.

This is because, no matter how much I knew, I always had to balance what I was doing. Dorian was the bottom line.

I would study how to get very physically fit. But then I would overdo it. And end up with very achey muscles and joints. I would try to stretch. And overdo that too. End up with less flexibility than before. Then I would rest. But I would lie in bed and get stiff.
Clearly I had anxiety. So I would meditate. That would help. But sometimes I would get anxious if the meditating didn't work. Some nights I wouldn't want to do it, but I would force myself to. Other times I would drive to a calm beach and take deep breaths. And get miserable that I didn't feel any better.

I knew that food was involved in anxiety. So I tried to eat right. I eliminated all sugar. But I continued to occasionally eat dairy (I'm lactose intolerant). Then I ate straight-up raw food. But I ended eating weird stuff like the peel of a mango or the seeds of an apple. I ended up with really bad food poisoning. I had an abusive girlfriend who pressured me to ignore the pain. I ended up eating lots of cheese and spicy food. Then I said "no more! I'll go on a juice fast." I did that for 2 weeks straight. I got skeletally skinny. I went back to eating normal food. Still had stomach aches.

I see the exact same thing in my friends and family. Shari was such a lover of positivity, peace, trusting the universe. That is, until she got mad. Then she'd scream at me and say mean things.

Haven't you ever met a very religious person? Who follows all the tenets of their religion down to the detail. But they have some glaring personality flaws. They aren't very nice to other people. Or they're racist against some group.

Rules for Life
==========
Family is everything

---------
Incorporate
---------
You might have some friends and relatives who are difficult to be around. You might be tempted to avoid them outright. But unless they are completely too much to handle, you should try to incorporate them. Stretch your beliefs of who can be incorporated. Hammer them into shape.

Because: you need a family one way or another. The best people to work with are the ones you've already got.


---------
Roles
---------
A family has roles
mother, father, big sister, big brother, little sister, little brother, grandma, grandpa, child, friend, rival, partner, lover, mentor, student
Every role needs to be filled by someone in your life
Filling the role lets you develop your identity and balance your emotions

**Trouble
In a 2-person relationship, you both need to fill 100% of those roles for one another. This is impossible. You can do a valiant job of context switching. But it's exhausting. And never what you really need.
This can lead us to problems. I might want you to simultaneously be my mentor and my lover. But one interferes with the other. So I pick one. Now you're frustrated. You wanted a mentor but are stuck with a lover. This is why we must have other relationships.
