Free Will is a difficult subject
a popular one for philosphers

We run into problems with free will every day
when it comes to everyday Procrastination
the willingness to go to the gym
the unwillingness to resist cake
compulsively looking at facebok

some people experience it big
like when it comes to addictions
to drugs or alcohol
like jon
or serious ocd
which shari gets. anj got. shari's mom has

I've personally run into these problems
during times that I've felt out of control
I'd overeat and hurt my digestion
or I was unable to stop helping anybody who asked
or I would get so angry in the moment and regret it later

The problem is
I would want to do the right thing
but wanting to stop wasn't enough

or worse
my willpower was strong enought to stop overeating
but before I knew it i had developed some other bad habit
like running myself ragged accepting any student

that's a real catch 22
because, no matter what "right thing" I dig my heels into
I alway find that I'm off-balance
I've dug my heels to far
my real problem is balance
and I can't find it in abstinence or in appeasement

I'll tell you what a few schools of thought have to say on the subject
and I'll tell you what I think

Alan Watts is a student of Zen Buddhism
and zen buddhism thinks about this issue
he describes the problem of "getting grace"
christian theologians talk about
if you want to be good, you need the "grace of god" to guide you
and to have the grace of god, you need to accept god into your heart
but if I'm wicked and I want to be good
and I need the grace of god to be good
how do I purposely accept god into my heart
if I haven't already?

his answer. and zen's answer
is to realize that you don't really have a say in these matters
that you're not "in control" of what you do like an operator with levers
you're more of a force of nature. like the wind. or a river
and the best you can do
is to not fret about your wickedness
to just accept yourself as you are
watch yourself from a step back, as if it's a movie
and if you manage that
then you'll ultimately accept god into your heart
and get grace. if that's your destiny

this is a common theme in zen
"let it be"
"let it go"
it's the purpose of meditation
to just sit with your feelings. let them flow as they are
without trying to change or name them

Alcoholics anonymous has a similar perspective
and they have almost 100 years of practical knowledge behind them
what they recommend to fight alcoholism
is a program of "self abandonment"
the way see it
alcoholism doesn't happen because you are sitting back and "allowing" yourself to run wild
it's because you are an anxious control freak
and you are actively trying to fix your feelings by self-medicating
or you are trying to beat down your feelings by withholding alcohol

so instead of trying to quote "control" your life
you identify that strong feeling of higherpowerness inside yourself
which we all seem to have. religious or not
and focus on that
with no strong plans in particular of what to "do"
and if you do that
you will find yourself doing the right thing
or, the rightest thing you can do

so, the funny thing is that
zen buddhism and AA
don't just end their books there
"okay, there's nothing for you to do, you have no free will bye"
there's thousands of pages of writings for stuff to do
mantras and activites
ask forgiveness from everyone you hurt, and such

so if you can't "do" anything
why do you need to do anything?

for me, the answer comes in something else Alan watts says
apparently Zen is largely concerned with how Rulers should govern their people
and Zen's recommendation to the ruler
is to "rule without ruling"
that is
be as permissive as possible
let the common folk do their thing
and only step in to nudge and guide things here and there
when absolutely necessary

in my experience
this is the truth
it's not that our conscious minds are powerless to affect our behavior
watching our bodies move as if in a dream
but
the conscious mind is only a small fraction of all the intelligent processes going on in the brain
and, despite, the "mind over matter" idiom
it's not infinitely powerful

it's not infinitely powerful
but it does sit at a point of high leverage
brute force is not what the conscious mind is best at
it operates using clever tricks
such as
focusing on the feeling of higher power
focusing on moment-to-moment sensations
making amends
asking for help
starting a routine
engaging in positive self-talk

and those thigns
especially over time
can have significant affects on your well-being and behavior
as evidenced by the popularity of AA and Zen

a metaphor
you might not be as physically strong as a 130-lb rottweiler
if it wants to chase a squirrel, you're screwed
but you could distract it with a juicy steak
or wrap its leash around a tree
or, if you give it deliberate careful training over a long time
it might learn to synchronize with you
and respect you enough to not drag you down the street

another metaphor
life is the ocean
your body is a boat
your subconscious is the wind
and conscious mind is the sail
the wind
your subconscious
which has some long-term plan
a current which flows in a pattern across the pacific
and it is irresistable
you can't sail directly backward into the wind
however
a skilled sailor can tack
and and sail at angles to the wind
so that, under the right circumstances
you can affect quite a lot
