**Trust**
Trust is a special subset of Acceptance
specifically for accepting other people or yourself
(especially accepting how things are 'going to be')
(like when you "let it go." let the arrow of your bow)

In a relationship
you have many opportunities to hurt each other
(it's high stakes)
or to hurt yourselves

you might want to control me
so I don't hurt meyself
or just so my life is made better for your wise decisionmaking

or you might be scared that, i'll get out of hand
so you have to nip my behavior in the bud
and constantly defend yourself
so i never get you under my thumb

or you might be scared to give up on a character you're playing
and act like your true self
(reveal you're not really enjoying sex right now)
in case it upsets me

all of these impulses
go against reality
which is

no matter how much you know better than me
you just don't have the time in the day to make all my decisions
and you can't literally force me to believe you

all these cases
rely on a fallacy
that because you can control one thing right now
you can control everything always
or even that if you can control something
that you should

last night I was mad at Shari
and I knew I had no right to be
I felt consciously that she didn't do anything wrong
but, viscerally. I felt mad. I felt she owed me an apology
and so I gently yelled at her. And said she was wrong

And she. Got mad back at me. And put me in my place.
And really convincingly told me she did nothing wrong. In fact, she was copying wrong behavior I'd already done plenty of times in the past

I knew something like this would happen
I knew that I was probably not right. I was fully within my power to do something different.
I could have said "you're right, you did nothing wrong."
Or just not said anything at all.
But I pressed on
Why?

Because, over the years of my Practice
I've gotten good at delegating
(Trust is something you practice. In little increments)
and I've learned to Trust my feelings
and I've come to Accept something about people

people aren't straightforward
the fabric of our relationships is woven in these intricate ways
right under our noses. that we don't even realize
pheromones get released. hormones
body language. tone of voice
sometimes you think you're teaching your kid a lesson based on what you say. but they learn a totally different lesson based on how you act when you say it
sometimes you fix a problem in your relationship by starting a fight. maybe I subconsciously knew shari had something big to say. but that she would never get up the energy to say it unless I provoked her a little

basically, there are simultaneous conversations
if you took my argument with Shari last night
and turned off the volume
and just watched our body language
you could do a new voiceover
and would be able to fit more than one story

for example, the story could go
"Shari. You have something big on your mind. And I know you're not saying it"
"No I don't"
"Yes you do!"
"Okay fine I do! God damn it! I'm so scared about having two foster kids! And I'm ashamed to say it!!" (**Precision**   **Expression**)

the thing is,
my frontal lobes will never be able to fully know what's going on
or even scratch the surface
I just need to trust that my emotions are working on their own projects
that they are intelligent and good at what they do
and I need to let them do their thing sometimes
even if the immediate outcome doesn't look good

even in the aftermath
Shari is a little upset still
doesn't want to say "I love you"
what I could do
is get all anxious that she's upset
and say "please forgive me! I'm so sorry!"
and bug her into saying "i love you"
but that would be missing the point
(way more injection of personality than necessary)
I can just see how it develops
and if things go bad. I can intervene
in the meantime. I gently say "i love you"
it hurts
it's a little scary
but I accept it
