Essays. What God is like.

A good explanation of God needs to explain suffering and evil and all

It doesn't need to explain where everythign came from. And you'll see why

If you look at the mandelbroit set

I think that god is higher-demensional being
incredibly different. Able to affect our lives in huge swaths we can hardly understand
transcends time. Exists in 7 dimensions

But, god is not infinite and all-enduring and all-powerful
God is just infinitely more powerful and enduring than us

And god has this ability to affect our lives
but doesn't directly change anything
god only works through the most subtle butterfly effect
affects the absolute barest minimum of things
which could have gone either way by the laws of quantum physics
so never defy reality

and god in its power sends this stream of tiny butterfly effects
that rattle the trees and make the birds sing
and it manifests as signals in our brain
and voice inside our heads
which sits side by side
but does not too much disturb our normal everyday functions
in this way god speaks to us and tries to help us in our lives

because god loves us
and is aware the the universe is a beautiful place filled with goodness
and deficient in evil
(and it's likely that there's not just one god, probably several of these huge creatures, made out of universes)
and tries to show us that the world is beautiful
and tries to help us manifest beauty in the world

however, god isn't all-powerful
but tries it's best
and so if we are hell-bent on committing genocide or something
god can't fully stop us

you might ask
if the universe is so good and decent
how could there be evil and torture?
the answer is that, we humans are more complex than we seem
everyone knows that
we appear to be just upright apes
but science knows that incredibly complex vibrations of atomic particles and fields
and beneath that we're a complete mathematical mystery

which means that when we suffer
there's more going on than we realize
in fact, when it gets to be terrible
we have an out-of-body experience
and that's when we really get on the same wavelength as god
and in those moments we see that god is right next to us all along
and we are comforted and lose all fear
and we remember that this is how all pain has always been
and we stay this way until the worst of the pain is over
and then we go back

it's like if you were put under anastesia for surgery
but in the middle
they woke you up
told you the secrets of the universe
then put you back to sleep
and when you woke up you forgot what happened
but you remember in the back of your mind the secrets of the universe

in that way suffering doens't really happen the way it looks
it's not great. but the mercy of the universe takes the edge off

and the best we can do in the universe
is to try and listen to the voice of god
as well as all our own local voices
and follow the path as well as possible
and when we die
we'll sleep for some time
and wake up to remember that we are much more complicated creatures than we realized
