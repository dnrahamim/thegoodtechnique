**Awareness**
"Just sit with your feelings"
"the only way out is in"
"invite them"
This is a crucial skill in Zen
which goes hand in hand with Acceptance

You don't resist them
but you can't just say "i don't resist!"
it doesn't work

instead you do something active
you invite them in
you say "come on in then, feelings!"

and then you find yourself in this soup of feelings
it feels like you're in a forest
or a music hall
or sitting by the ocean
and the waves have personalities
and the wind has a personality
and the chattering animals
hundreds of personalities
like fractals

the thing is
the more time you spend sitting in this soup of feelings
the better you get to know it
and the more you see things repeat

you see the colors and swirls of anger
and sadness
and.. hunger
and kinkiness
and you get to know yourself in a way that you didn't know yourself before

why is this important?
because
we have this tendency
to put things into boxes
especially our feelings

but our feelings don't fit neatly into boxes
we say "i'm jealous"
or "i'm mad" or "i'm miserable"
but really, there's a whole swirling rainbow storm of feelings going on
complex, changing, interwoven stuff

and we like to assign reasons
and make decisons
based on those boxes
but really
we probably don't know the reasons
and probably don't need to be making huge decisions right now
