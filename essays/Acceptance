**Acceptance**
When buddha achieved enlightenment, he wrote down 4 noble truths
One of the most well-known truth is the first one, often translated as
"life is suffering"
which doesn't mean "life is one big horrible torment"
but more means "there's no way to totally avoid pain. every day will have plenty of it"

the next 3 truths go on to say that attachment is the root of all suffering
and that the cure it to let go of your attachments
but I want to focus on truth #1
and how buddha came to it

Buddha, whose real name was Gautama was a real person
who lived during a time where the world was overflowing with priests, monks, and holy people claiming to have become enlightened
this is how things still are today

Gautama, like many of us, was unsatisfied with life
pain, embarrassment, fear
but so many holy men claimed
that if you only practiced their philosopy. often a very grueling one
you could train yourself to dissocate with pain. to look past it. and reach a state of unfettered happiness

the attitude of the day
was that enlightenment was attained through ascetecism
meaning, deprivation. meaning masochism
and Gautama was very good at it

he fasted and sat in uncomfortable positions and wasted away
for years and years
and still felt the same old embarrassments, uncomfortabilities, kinky thoughts, and everything
until one day
while he was wasting away under a tree
he thought "jesus, this is stupid."
and he was enlightened
and he became Buddha

what buddha realized
is that there is no way to stop being an average person
who gets hemorrhoids and stuff
we are all totally screwed forever

and the next thing he realized
is that accepting reality
really takes the edge off!

for years he was so anxious to find the truth
and reach next-level matrix nirvana
and stop being so miserable
but really, that anxiety was the most miserable part of it all
and when he admitted that the pain in his butt or the hunger in his tummy was never going away
suddenly it didn't all seem so bad

in relationships
we spend a significant amount of time
trying to change one another
this is the ultimate root of conflict

you have your elbow in my ribs
I say "ow!" "put your elbow somewhere else!"
or more realistically
you don't listen about my day at work when I come home
and I want you to start listening



buddha wasn't the first to come up with the idea
that you should "accept reality"
there are plenty of western idioms which encourage the same thing
"don't make a mountain out of a mole hill"
"no use crying over spilled milk"
"don't worry be happy"
Jewish philosophy tells a story
"kol ha olam kulo. gesher tsar meod"



here are some important things to accept in a relationship:
Youre relationship isn't going to be perfect
It's not going to be like some canned formula. Like disney or anything. You don't need to be as manly as you think. Or as feminine.
You don't need to stay the same way all the time
You don't need to be the only two people in the house. Have friends. Polyamory. Whatever feels right.
You're going to fight. You don't have to go crazy preventing fights.
It's okay to go to bed angry. Why not?
You don't have to live together. Or spend every night together. Or sleep together. Or call each other all the time.
You don't have to be lovedy dovey.
You can't get married after a year. It doesn't have to be like the relationships everyone else has that last 10 years.
You can break up. And get back together. Why not?
You don't have to say everything on your mind. Or know 100% of each other's heads. Or secrets. Have some privacy if you want.
You can have a crush on someone else if you want. You can say so or not.




That doesn't mean that there aren't rules. But the rules are way less specific than that
