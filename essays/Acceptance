**Acceptance**
When buddha achieved enlightenment, he wrote down 4 noble truths
One of the most well-known truth is the first one, often translated as
"life is suffering"
This is a big revelation. You can find it written down in books and internet articles. As a big revelation about what it takes to live on this earth.
But also it's weird. It's a sort of morbid opinion "life is suffering." Why would we want to see life this way? And why would it help us be happy and functional?
Well, the answer shas to do with a technique which is essential for relationships with our loved ones. Acceptance. 

To begin, the phrase "life is suffering" it's meant to mean that "life is one big horrible torment." It means something more like "suffering is unavoidable. every day will have plenty of it"

How did buddha come to this realization?
Well. Buddha, whose real name was Gautama was a real person
who lived during a time where the world was overflowing with priests, monks, and holy people claiming to have become enlightened
(this is how things still are today)

Gautama, like many of us, was unsatisfied with life. Especially its foibles. pain, embarrassment, fear
but so many holy men claimed. that if you only practiced their philosopy (often a very grueling one) you could train yourself to dissocate with pain. to look past it. and reach a state of unfettered happiness

the attitude of the day
was that enlightenment was attained through ascetecism
meaning, deprivation. meaning masochism
and Gautama was very good at it

he fasted and sat in uncomfortable positions and wasted away
for years and years
and still felt the same old embarrassments, uncomfortabilities, kinky thoughts, and everything
until one day
while he was wasting away under a tree
he thought "jesus, this is stupid."
and he was enlightened
and he became Buddha

...boom...

Let's elaborate.
What buddha realized
is that there is no way to stop being an average person
who gets hemorrhoids and stuff
we are all totally screwed forever

and that this fact is patently obvious
100% of everyone whose ever lived goes through life having hemorrhoids
it's a sort of mystical pipe dream to think we can one day be free of discomfort and pain

but, for some reason, everyone is constantly trying to do it
everyone is always tring to get more money, sex, status
or seeking out religions or holy men
not, purely fun of money or intrigue of religion
but tinged with this relentless expecation
that if we could just get it right
all this misery would finally be over
and we could finally get on with our earthly life of 99% bliss

the fact is "life is suffering"
but that is very difficult to accept

This relates to relationships like this:
in relationships
we spend a significant amount of time
in Denial
refusing to acknowledge facts about each other. about our relationship. about ourselves. about our life together
which are right under our nose
and so we spend time on fruitless pursuits. trying to change one another. trying to hide ourselves. living in the city when we'd prefer the country
this is a big root-cause of relationship conflict

I have done this infinite times in my relationships. And it's been done to me infinite times
Shari has OCD. She likes the refidgerator organized with small items on top, large on the bottom. For two years, I acted like this quirk would go away if I just acted like it didn't exist. Surprise. It didn'g go away and Shari and I have argued about it for 2 years

Example 2: I had a relationship with Anj. For years, I spoke in a lower register than my true voice. I am a sensitive person. But I never acted that way. In fact, I practically forgot I was sensitive.

Example 3: My friend David expects me to call him. That's not the relationship I want!

So what is the cure to this problem?
Well the buddha thought about that one
he was resigned and defeated from years of trying to reach perfect blissful nirvana
so buddha tried accepting everything
he accepted that his life is never going to be perfect. he'll always be a little miserable. there's always some chance he'll get sick or get struck by lightning or something

well he fully expected to just be a miserable person like everyone else
but next thing he realized
he felt amazing!
more amazing than he ever felt

for years he was so anxious to find the truth
and to basically become an angel on earth
and stop suffering all the time
but really, the worst part of life in a human body
was that desperation to avoid the bad stuff
and when he admitted
that the pain in his neck or the hunger in his tummy was never going away
suddenly it didn't all seem so bad
in fact, it really felt like pure bliss!

so buddha carved out 3 more noble truths
which go on to say that "attachments" or "hangups" are the root of all suffering
and that the cure it to let go of your hangups
meaning, you look reality in the face
and accept every reality you've been avoiding
no matter how painful

this is a very powerful realization
for people like us
who love to live in imaginationland

like all good ideas
great minds think alike
buddha wasn't the first to that you should "accept reality"
western idioms
"don't make a mountain out of a mole hill"
"no use crying over spilled milk"
mean "be sad in proportion to the actual badness of the event"

Jewish philosophy tells a story
"kol ha olam kulo. gesher tsar meod"
"life is a narrow bridge. and the most important thing is: don't be afraid"
meaning "life is scary and dangerous. accept that you might fall"

and of course, this attitude carries over the the nexus of our lives
our close relationships
accepting our shortcomings and quirks
is the fastest route to relationship happiness

here are some important things to accept in a relationship:
Youre relationship isn't going to be perfect
It's not going to be like some canned formula. Like disney or anything. You don't need to be as manly as you think. Or as feminine.
You don't need to stay the same way all the time
You don't need to be the only two people in the house. Have friends. Polyamory. Whatever feels right.
You're going to fight. You don't have to go crazy preventing fights.
It's okay to go to bed angry. Why not?
You don't have to live together. Or spend every night together. Or sleep together. Or call each other all the time.
You don't have to be lovedy dovey.
You can get married after a year. It doesn't have to be like the relationships everyone else has that last 10 years.
You can break up. And get back together. Why not?
You don't have to say everything on your mind. Or know 100% of each other's heads. Or secrets. Have some privacy if you want.
You can have a crush on someone else if you want. You can say so or not.

that isn't to say that you don't have rules in our realtionships
that we don't try to improve them
or change ourselves
or avoid disaster scenarios
or even change each other
those are all good in right

but generally speaking. we overdo these thigns to an aggregious degree
and if we apply conscious energy
to noticing how things actually are
and the trajectory for how they can actually change
even if it hurts to notice that
we will be much more successful. and more happy





you have your elbow in my ribs
I say "ow!" "put your elbow somewhere else!"
or more realistically
you don't listen about my day at work when I come home
and I want you to start listening



That doesn't mean that there aren't rules. But the rules are way less specific than that
