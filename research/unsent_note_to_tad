i sympathize with you very much
you deserve to feel frustrated
and disappointed
relationships have given you a lot of grief
your dad was cruel to you
and taught you that something was wrong with you
you got caught in that love triangle at school
people excluded you in college
you were lonely in new haven
you got caught up in that absusive yeshiva
those things are terrible
you are a sensitive person
they don't roll off you or anyone
it doesn't just disappear
it hurts for a very long time
it would hurt anyone
i identify
and any time you want to talk about your feelings
i'm prepared to listen
but let's be clear
you are negative
all that isolation and cruelty that happened to you
seeped into your brain
and made you think that you deserved it somehow
and now you say things like you're a burden or nobody will ever like you
i get that you're frustrated
but keep in mind the reality
you are perfect
you are good
you are a creature of god like anyone else
you are friendly and funny
people were cruel to you because those people were confused and emotionally ill
not because of you
any time you act like something is wrong with you
you're not being logical
you're living in fantasyland
know what you should keep up?
being a friendly guy
the times that you are positive
and act like you deserve to have friends
that's the best side of you
that's the real side of you
the times that you act negative
and scowl
that's not you
that's an act
that's constipated sadness turning into resentment
keep up being positive and friendly
fool
tell stories and facts and history and philosophy
help other people out
support shari
say nice things to her
say nice things to everyone
act like you deserve our friendship
don't be afraid
act like you deserve to be treated well
i love your uplifting facebook posts
i love every time you actually say how you feel
instead of putting yourself down or complaining about life in some roundabout way
you know else?
I don't know your whole life
but it looks like whatever you're doing is working
it looks like you're finding yourself among close friends
who care about you
like shari and me
don't you have friends?
isn't that pretty good?
keep that shit up
you're still hurting from all the abuse you've suffered
have some compassion for Tad
don't put so much pressure on him
