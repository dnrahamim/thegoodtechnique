feelings are like a high-resolutio photograph
words and concepts are like a low-resolution version of that photograph
and the thing is, you can come up with many low-res versions



and important part of being on a team
is being on the same page
about issues that matter
if I say "the boiler's overflowing"
and you go "yea the boiler's kindof hot, got it"
I'm going to be nervous
because you aren't taking seriously
something that is very serious!


*getting in sync*
**i correct your behavior, you correct mine**
(push me, pull you)
the point of getting in sync is to develop routines around each other
if i have OCD or just like my pasta with no sauce
or if we have plants that need watering
i want you to learn that
so taht we get to the point that everything gets done seamlessly
no extra effort, no forgetting, no yelling. just action

a good deal of getting in sync happens automatically
unconscously
i copy things that you do and say
i develop your same taste in food and music
i copy the way you do your chores
i start doing my chores the same way i did on the last team i was on
(if you get 10 experienced software engineers, football players in a room. we'll just assemble ourselves into a fuctioning machine)

but, 10% has to be done explicitly
I need to
1. ask you to do brand new stuff
2. ask you to STOP doing old stuff and do new stuff


when we're desperate, we have a hard time with nuance
we tend to want to "cling" to something
many people choose the wrong thing
career, politics, drugs, cynicism, perfectionsim, hatred
the correct thing is family
