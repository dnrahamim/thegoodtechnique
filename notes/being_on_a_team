being on a team

the reason that we form relationships
is to be
better off together
than we are apart

if this stops being true
and the cost to fix our relationship
becomes higher than the value of fixing it
it's our job to split up

needs
each member of a team has their own
individual needs
emotional and material

the needs of the individual
become
the needs of the team

material needs
paying bills
cooking
carpooling
doing chores
having fun
singing songs
fighting bullies
getting jobs

emotional needs
provide support
love
advice
honest criticism
protection
encouragement

jobs
to get all that stuff done
we have jobs

we do some jobs as individuals
who cooks, who takes out the trash

and we do other jobs together
singing, fighting bullies, love and support

the better we do our jobs
together and alone
the better off the team is

(the goal of a relationship
is to develop a seamless daily routine
where we become experts
at doing our daily jobs
whic provide for our own
and each others'
material and emotional needs)


human resources
on any team
we do our best work
when we economize our resources

economize means
that we put our material resources
money, time, food
toward their highest-priority
possible uses

but we also need to makes sure
that we economize our
human resources

that means we put our
talents, passions, knowledge
toward their highest-priority
possible uses

to do so
we must communicate

this means that we are always
trading jobs
providing advice
providing criticism
and asking for help

so that we can stop doing things that are not useful
and start doing things that are
