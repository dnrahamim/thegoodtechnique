we overlook the obvious
the mantras are to keep the obvious in mind
(not everyone is the same dorian)

the good technique
is like a long mantra. to be repeated
things that maybe are obvious individually




**A Process**
Allow yourself to basicaly run on autopilot
Engage when you feel an alarm of panic, pain, or similar strong impulse

some of your jobs:
1. Make a concrete ruling. Suppose I am at work and I'm nervious because I want to leave AND I want to stay and finish. Stop and make a ruling: i need to stay until the serious job of evaluating the deploy is done. After the ruling, i will feel less conflicted.

2. Negotiate compromise. Alright, let's stretch then. That's part of what I want out of this leaving business. Remember that you don't know all of the reasons behind your feelings. Test out a few options and see how they feel.


**Personality**
For humans, personality can be thought of as a natural resource.
In a family, you have a pool of personality from which to draw
and you want complete coverage in that pool

you want mothers, brothers, grandmothers, children, friends
you want to have warriors, teachers, preachers, healers
you want to have available plenty of facial expressions, tones of voice, body language, meters of speech
character attributes like courageous, shy, energetic, wrathful
habits. like brushing teeth. bedtime. eating
obedience. dedication. food preferences.
ideas. points of view. convictions. outside the box thinking


In our lives we have all these feelings
Our personality is how those feelings take shape
In our minds and on the surface in our expressions and actions

We all have our own inherent personalities
from babyhood on
our personality is what we use to communicate with strangers, loved ones, coworkers
it's how we express our feelings
it's how we interpret and relate to our feelings
