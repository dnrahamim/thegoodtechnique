Summary

This is about conflict resolution. How to have more productive less painful conflicts.

=====
Intro
=====
Conflict is unavoidable in a relationship. People get grumpy, get under each other's skin, and have disagreements. It's commonly believed that conflict is a purely bad thing. After all, nobody likes getting grumpy and arguing. Some people try to avoid conflict altogether. But even though conflicts are painful, they do serve a productive purpose.

Typicially we keep our true feelings to ourselves. Conflict provides an opportunity for you and your partner get your true feelings out on the table. By the end of a conflict, you should reach a resolution where you and your partner agree on new terms which will prevent the same situation from breaking out in the future. When it's over, you should both feel closer and more understanding of one another.

Of course, this is not how most conflicts go down. In the real world, conflict means anger, guilt, and hurt feelings. When you and your partner have conflict, your participate in things like sarcasm, name calling, glaring, talking down, yelling, and all other forms of negativity. You feel as if you are engaged in a battle. You think about your relationship in terms of "winning" and "losing," of "standing your ground" and "giving up." These conflicts are rarely resolved in a way which leaves you and your partner feeling satisfied and closer to one another. Generally, they just fizzle out and you never talk about them again.

Conflicts like these are unproductive. Instead of bringing you closer in your partnership, each conflict takes you two steps backward. And the longer you handle your conflicts this way, the deeper you fall into a vicious cycle. You develop negative feelings about your partner. You feel that they actually "want" to hurt you or that they don't care about you at all. You have many unhealed injuries and tensions in your home are quick to escalate. You know that another bad conflict is going to happen sooner or later.

Of course you're always trying your best to communicate with your partner. But once you're caught up in a vicious cycle, it's very hard to get out. You try and say how you feel but the message just does not get through to your partner. They brush you off, belittle you, or even get angry at you for trying to communicate clearly.

If this goes on long enough, you might think about leaving your partner. But if you can't or won't or shouldn't, you end up feeling trapped and frustrated. In the end you just resign yourself to the idea that things will never get better. That's your life and there's no use rocking the boat.

As much as you want to act nonchalant about your relationship problems, we both know that poor conflict resolution is a significant stress on your life. For one thing, your partner never learns to treat you the way that you want to be treated. How can you relax knowing that your partner might invade your boundaries at any second. For another thing, you never learn how to avoid the same conflicts in the future. How can you relax knowing that anything you say or do might explode a whole new conflict. And most importantly, you and your partner never get the chance to take back the mean things you've said and done. How can you feel safe around someone who has hurt you so many times and will certainly hurt you again? That is not a healthy way to live.

The truth is that you don't have to live this way. Your relationship can be better and it will get better with my help. Communication is hard and you've failed many times in the past. But back then, you didn't have any tools.

When you're doing any job, you need the right tools. If you're trying to pull a 4 inch nail that's 3 inches deep in a piece of wood, you don't use your fingers. You get a hammer. If you want to lift a car, you could never do it with your own muscles. But a jack makes it easy.

And if you want to resolve a conflict, your intuition doesn't always serve you well. But I'm going to provide you with tools that make every conflict more productive. I'm going to show you exactly the do's and don'ts. I'll teach you how to set strict boundaries while never crossing over your partners. You will learn how to express how you feel, bring out the best in your partner, and get treated the way you deserve to be treated. Of course, you can only change your own behavior. But if you follow my advice, you will feel better at the end of a conflict, no matter what your parter does.

The Program
===========
----------------
Acknowledgements
----------------
You are here to improve your own life.
The first step of this program is to acknowledge that you are here to improve your own life. You're not here to be nice, you're not here to do the right thing, you're not here to be a martyr. Human beings are extremely sensitive creatures and our relationships are everything to us. Acknowledge that the poor communication in your relationship hurts you and you deserve better. This is the most certain way to become happier and healthier in your life.

You can't change your partner.
Come to terms with the fact you can't change your partner. Nobody has that power. Your partner may never get the message and may always stay angry and confused. You are learning how to set your own healthy boundaries and respect your partner's boundaries for your own sake. This way of living will improve your life even if your partner never changes their ways. To some extent, your partner will have no choice but to treat you better. By your own actions you will feel better, and you will treat yourself better.

You are part of the problem.
Come to terms with the fact that you are not perfect. Nobody is perfect, you are no exception. You are a good person and you are always trying your best. But you have a temper, you get negative, you don't listen. You might argue that your partner is the bigger part of the problem. That your partner is more mean, negative, and unrespesponsive. That may be true, but that doesn't change the fact that there are apologies you deserve to give and changes that you need to make about your own behavior. Learn to admit that you're wrong.

The good technique works.
In the following pages you might think that I'm asking you to be "nice" to your partner. You might not like this idea. You might say "If my partner is disrespecting and hurting me, why should I be nice?" We are not following this program because we want to be nice. We're following it because it works.
In the following pages you might think that I'm asking you to admit defeat. You might say "if I just let my partner win, then they'll walk all over me." The reality is the opposite. Negativity in a relationship signals weakness. The strongest upper hand you can ever gain on another person is by treating them with respect and kindness. Even if someone is very abusive, even if they are crazy, you don't gain anything by crossing the line and acting ugly to them. Even if you have to leave comeone, even if you have to call the cops or put them in a headlock, you are doing so with compassion and understanding at the front of your mind.

The good technique is not infallible.
Throughout this program you are going to find every reason imaginable to doubt, deflect, and throw in the towel. Resist this temptation. Relationships don't change overnight. It takes three months to potty train a dog. Your human relationship will take even more time. But even the smallest steps of progress are a huge relief.

(You are doing the right thing)

A Healthy Relationship
----------------------
Many of us live our entire lives without ever participating in a deeply healthy relationship or without seeing a healthy relationship to model after. We get a lot of our relationship information from what we see on TV or read in books. This leaves us with a handicap. It is important to understand what a healthy relationship looks like so you know what to demand from your partner. It is also important to know what what lines you must not cross. The following are the rules for a healthy relationship:

1. You have no wrong feelings
2. Your feelings are not wrong even if they make your partner feel bad
3. Your feelings are important
4. You deserve to express your feelings
5. You can't change how you feel
6. You deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated
7. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. If you do anything, you should feel good about it
8. If you got hurt, you deserve an apology. You are the only one who knows if you got hurt
9. You don't need to tolerate abuse, even from a very sick/sad person
10. There is never any valid reason to threaten, belittle, attack, or disrespect. Even if your partner did the same things to you. If you did these things, then it's your job to apologize
11. It's okay to break up

The rules for a healthy relationship are not just theoretical. They are talking points and places to stand your ground. Think of them as your Bill of Rights. Throughout your relationship, your partner is going to try to convince you that your relationship allows for some unhealthy exception.

For example, you partner might try to convince you that one of your feelings is a "wrong" feeling. They might say "You shouln't be jealous of me for spending time with my best friend. That's petty." Or "You shouldn't get angry at me for throwing out your old shirt. Grow up" The reality, or course, is that you have no wrong feelings. You can't turn your feelings off, and you shouldn't try to. Certainly, you shouldn't yell and call names because of your feelings. And you should try not to get hysterical. But that's different from having "wrong feelings".

This situation happens over and over. Your partner will relentlessly try to bend every rule of healthy relationships. Your partner will try to convince you: that your feelings don't matter on their birthday because they are the more important than you. Or that you shouldn't express your feelings because it's too painful to listen to you. Or that you have to have sex tonight because that's what you agreed to when you got married. Or that you don't deserve an apology because it happened so long in the past. Or that you screwed up dinner so that's why it was okay to call you stupid. The list could go on forever.

When this happens, you should rely on the rules for a healthy relationship. Trust them and don't back down. Say them to your partner with conviction:
1. I have no wrong feelings
2. My feelings are not wrong even if they make you feel bad
3. My feelings are important
4. I deserve to express my feelings
5. I can't change how I feel
6. I deserve to be treated the way I want to be treated
7. I don't have to do anything I don't want to do
8. I deserve an apology. I'm the only one who knows if I got hurt
9. I don't need to tolerate abuse
10. There's never a reason to disrespect me
11. It's okay to break up

Conflict
========
99% of our time in a relationship is peaceful. Most of our activity is spent eating together, sitting together, going out, watching tv, brushing our teeth, and sleeping. When a conflict suddenly breaks out it doesn't last long, maybe an hour if that. But even though we only spend 1% of our time fighting, these moments are what determine the course of our relationships.

There are endless reasons for two people to fight. Money, politics, sex. Forgotten birthdays. Unwanted comments. Misunderstood anxiety. Your partner slurps their cheerios to loudly. You want to get to the show on time but your partner always make you late. Uncalled-for disrespect.

A conflict happens in 3 parts. They start out hot and gradually cool down.
1. The early  moments of a conflit are usually where the most damage is done. When a fight breaks out, you tend to yell, glare, and be generally negative. This negative behavior, even if it feel justified, is poisonous for your relationship.

2. The middle part of a conflict should contain a discussion. This is where you actually talk about the issue at hand in a neutral way. You talk about why your birthday matters so much to you or why you're always late for the show.

3. The last part of a conflict is the resolution. This is where you both get back onto the same page. Here you each apologize to one another for the negativity that happened along the way. You agree on what you each  expectat from your relationship. And you make an agreement about what you're each going to do differently moving forward.

Mom/Dad Specific Conflict
In Times of Peace
Tell Mom something nice.
You need to establish positive feelings toward each other. Freak mom out one day by looking her in the eyes and saying "I care about you Sue." If that's too big a step, send her a text message that says "I care about you Sue." If that's too big a step, just buy her flowers. Or a get her a card.

No matter what you say, the point is to make mom feel that you care about her. Make her feel that she is a human being and that she matters in this world. This is essential for any functional relationship. If mom feels that you don't care about her, why should she be nice to you? Would you be nice to someone who doesn't give a damn about you?
But if you can make mom believe that you care about her, then she will treat you better. If she becomes convinced that you care about her, she will lose her inclination to disrespect you and will be open to changing her behavior. In addition, 90% of all the snapping at you that mom does is perceived self-defense. If mom doesn't feel that you hate her, she won't need to defend herself from you. 

This is by far the easiest way to create peace in your home. If you do this on a regular basis, your conflicts will become significantly more peaceful and a significant number of conflicts will be avoided altogether.

You might object "but I don't feel that way toward her any more. We've been through too many bad things." I know that you don't feel passionate for Mom these days. I know you're not sure that you even love her or if you want to be buried next to her. But the fact of the matter is that you live together. You spend time together. You're married. You loved each other once. You spent 30 years together. Like it or not, you care about her. Human beings care about the people they are close to.

If you don't feel honest saying "I love you," then don't say it. You should only ever speak from the heart. But if you dig deep, you will always find some phrase that lets your partner know that they are more than a stranger to you. Say "you are important to me" or "I care about how you feel" or "I want you to be happy" or "You are my wife and my partner." Saying something earnest like this will probably not feel comfortable. That's fine. If anything, feeling a little uncomfortable means you're on the right track.

Don't skip this step. There are no unimportant steps in this book. Once you choose your positive phrase, we're going to reuse it over and over throughout the following techniques.


Apologize
Over the years you and Mom have had many hundreds of conflicts. Regardless of who was wrong or right, those conflicts left both of you feeling hurt and confused. To this day, you and Mom still carry those hurt feelings inside of you. And with those hurt feelings you each also carry negative feelings toward each other.

While you can't change history and you can't erase those hurt feelings, there is something useful that you can do: apologize. We teach children to apologize when they get into a fight. Why should it be any different for adults?

Go ahead an apologize any time of day. An apology doesn't have to be elaborate or elagant. While you're standing around in the kitchen or just after you get home from work, just come out and say "I want to apologize for the last time we argued." Or try "I know I'm not always that nice. So, I'm sorry." Maybe there's something specific that you want to apologize for. For example, you might say "I'm sorry that I told you that you're fat and that you're a cold fish" or "I'm sorry for losing my temper and breaking one of our vases."

The point of this exercise isn't to find the precise right words. It's simply to apologize and to mean it. Think back to the negative things that you said to Mom. Feel rightfully sad that you said those things. Now, put those feelings into words and aplogize.

An apology works very well for several reasons. By apologizing to Mom, you show that you care about her. After years of conflict, Mom has started to think that you don't care about her. She feels that, when the two of you fight, you say negative things purely because you don't like her. By apologizing, you correct Mom's negative line of thinking. You are telling her that you do care about her, that you don't want her to feel hurt, and that you are willing to humble yourself to make her feel better. This establishes the prescedent that Mom is your priority and reinforces her belief that the two of you are on a team.

Apologizing also makes you nonthreatening. Over the years Mom has come to see you as an antagonist. When she pictures you in her mind, many of her memories involve you doing and saying negative things to her. What's worse, she feels that you are proud of your negative behavior and that you have every intention of hurting her again. But when you apologize, you show Mom that you are aware of your negative behavior and that you are not proud of it. You clarify that you don't do negative things because you enjoy it, you do it because you're a human being and you are imperfect. Most importantly, it let's Mom know that you want to do better.

By letting Mom know that you want to do better, you are, little by little, bringing mom onto your "team." Before, your temper was something that you dealt with on your own. It was something that you both lived with, but didn't talk about. Now your temper is a project that you and Mom work on together. After the two of you have a fight, you can at least apologize, and try to improve your tempers in the future.

As a result, Mom will treat you better. She will have more patience and more willing to agree with you. She will be more willing to compromise and happier to do you favors. You will find her smiling at you more

She will also be less inclined to be negative.

By apologizing, Mom is more likely to apologize to you.

You might say "But what if it's not the right time to apologize? What if I'm opening up old wounds?"

You might say "Why should I apologize? Mom hurt me too"


Getting Angry
Sometimes, Dad does something that irritates you. For example, he makes you late to the show by waiting until the last minute to get ready. You deserve to tell him that it's not fair for him to make you both late; that he's making you feel disrespected and unimportant. He might even start criticizing you and calling you names.

It's your job to say how you feel. But the important thing is to not be negative. You must avoid all attitudes and words that would hurt Dad's feelings. This means no sarcasm, no yelling, no accusations, no namecalling, no glaring, no bug eyes, no clenched fists, no pointing fingers.

The reason that you do not *act* negative, even if you feel negative, is because acting negative will only inflame the situation. When a dog barks in the house, you don't respond by yelling even louder than the dog. That would only rile the dog up more. In the same way, if dad irritates you, you don't respond with anger and irritation. That's only going to rile dad up and make him want to disrespect you.

You might say "so what am I supposed to do, just let dad walk all over me?" No, of course not. Instead you let dad know that you're not okay with his behavior without being negative. For this purpose, you use somethign called an "I" statement. An "I" statement is a statement about yourself; not about dad. Typically, such statements start with something like "I feel," "I want," "I like," et cetera. For example, you tell dad "It feel bad when we're late to the show." Or "It hurts my feelings when you yell at me."
An I statement works best when you talk about your feelings. The more silly you feel, the more you sound like a little kid, the better. It's always great to say "you're hurting my feelings." It's always great to say "please" as in "please don't yell at me." I like saying "It makes me sad" or "I feel bad" or "I don't feel good about this."
An I statement works poorly when you focus too much on dad's wrongdoings or use the opportunity to say negative things. It's unproductive to say "It hurts my feelings when you treat me like shit," or "I feel bad that you only care about yourself." In that case, dad is going to get defensive. These statements sound like they're about you, but they contain negative judgements about dad. It's better to stick to the facts: "It hurts my feelings when you forget my birthday" or "I feel bad when you criticize me in front of my family."

An I statement works for several reasons. The most important reason that an I statement works is because it gets to the heart of the issue. You. Your feelings. Dad (like all people) thinks that every situation is about himself. He thinks that the only reason you're criticizing him is to put him down. When you use "I" statements, you are insisting "this isn't about you. I'm not here to put you down. All I want is to get to show on time and to feel that I am respected"
For another thing, "I" statement humanize; they make you appear nonthreatening. After all these years of struggle with dad, he's come to to see himself as a big victim and you as a big antagonist. Dad is capable of responding to almost anything you do or say as you are threatening or criticizing him. But when you act like a little kid and say "It hurts my feelings" it catches dad off guard. He is more likely to take responsibility for his actions if he cam be confinced that he's hurt your feelings.

Throughout this process you might say "this isn't fair. If dad is going to disrespect, why should I act calm and be nice?" You're right, it's not fair. You deserve to be treated with respect and understanding. But if you want to have a happy life and a happy relationship, you're going to have to get used to being the bigger person.
Think of this exercise as "hypnotizing" dad. People are monkey-see monkey-do creatures. The way that you act is the same way dad is going to act. If you want dad to be calm and rational, you have to be calm and rational. Eventually, inevitably, he's going to unlearn his bad habits and relearn good habits from you.

What if Being Calm Doesn't Work?
You might be all on board with the techniques in the last section. You want to be calm and say how you feel. But what if Dad isn't on board? What if you are sweet and calm and say things like "It hurts my feelings when we're late for the show" but Dad keeps on doing the things that hurt your feelings.
For this situation, you your tool is to use Persistence. Being positive doesn't mean that you have to be a pushover. Be adamant that you must be treated the way that you want to be treated. Continue to repeat phrases like "I don't feel good about this situation." And "I want you to respect how I feel."
When Dad does something that hurts your feelngs, you need to see your hurt feelings as a priority in your life. You may be tempted to ignore those feelings for the sake of returning to the status quo, but that will only feed the tension beneath the surface of your relationship. You deserve an Apology and a Resolution. If you have the time, insist that ou want to continue talking about the issue. If you don't have the time, make it clear that you want to talk about the issue in the future.
You may not be able to get Dad to apologize and resolve the issue the first time. He might try to avoid the discussion for days and days. But eventually, he's going to have no choice but to face you as a human being. This is what you want. You want dad to invest himself in a conversation about your feelings. This might manifest itself as an angry fight. But if it's a fight you need to have, then it's worth getting it over with so you can move closer in your relationship.

Reopening a Conflict (middle cycle)


Resolve the Conflict (close it out)


----------
Boundaries
----------
Every conflict is about boundaries. Boundaries are an essential part of any relationship. Any time you make a clear distinction between what you are okay with and what you are not you are setting a boundary.

During a conflict 

A conflict is as if you're driving a race car.

 
Strict boundaries are essential
You must not let your boundaries get crossed
You must not cross your partner's boundaries
Your goal is to stay in the middle

Shame and Punishment
--------------------
Elvis didn't call to schedule 2 payments and now they had to pay a ton after their car got repossessed. Sure. he did the wrong thing. But the point isn't to yell and tell him how bad he is until he decides to be good again. 1. You reality check the man if he needs one. 2. you figure out what needs to change in his life (the reality check is probably related)


 I'm going to get you to look at the play-by-play of what happens in a conflict. I'm going to show you examples of healthy and unhealthy conflicts. We'll look at techniques

 you and your partner can both live a happier life together. As long as you're planning to live together, you owe it to yourself to try to handle your conflicts better. Whatever effort you put into your relationship, you will get back double in the reduction of stress and quadrouple in the understanding and warmth that your partner gives to you. It's doable and it's worth the effort.

And here's why it's doable. The truth is that deep down you and your partner care about each other very much. When two people spend years and decades together, that's what happens, there's no avoiding it. You might not feel like you care about each other, but you do many acts of service for your partner every day which show that you really do. You certainly don't want to hurt each other and you don't want your relationship to be a battlefield or a power struggle.

So then why do you fight? Because you are SENSITIVE PEOPLE caught up in a vicious cycle. All you want to is to be cared for and respected to and treated the way that you want to be treated. And what you'll find is that, as soon as your partner starts to treat you with respect and show interest in your feelings, all positive feelings toward your partner will start flooding back.


A Relationship
A relationship is must more than companionship and love. A human being needs a partner to get by. You need someone who can understand how you feel and help interpret it for you.

As a team, you are contantly working to solve each other's problems. If there's something bothering you in your life, you put that feeling into words, and then you say those words. Although your privacy is your right to keep, there should be no feeling that you can't share with your parnter.

What if your partner doesn't like how you feel? What if you need to tell your partner that you don't enjoy spending time with their mother? Or that you think all the time about quitting your job? Your partner may be unhappy. Your feelings may change the dynamic of your relationship. They may not be able to enjoy things you used to do together. Your partner may be defensive at first, scared, or angry. But ultimately, your partner knows that you did the right thing by saying how you feel.
