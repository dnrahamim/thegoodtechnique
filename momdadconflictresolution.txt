Summary

This is about conflict resolution. How to have more productive less painful conflicts.

=====
Intro
=====
Conflict is unavoidable in a relationship. People get grumpy, get under each other's skin, and have disagreements. It's commonly believed that conflict is a purely bad thing. After all, nobody likes getting grumpy and arguing. Some people try to avoid conflict altogether. But even though conflicts are painful, they do serve a productive purpose.

Typicially we keep our true feelings to ourselves. Conflict provides an opportunity for you and your partner get your true feelings out on the table. By the end of a conflict, you should reach a resolution where you and your partner agree on new terms which will prevent the same situation from breaking out in the future. When it's over, you should both feel closer and more understanding of one another.

Of course, this is not how most conflicts go down. In the real world, conflict means anger, guilt, and hurt feelings. When you and your partner have conflict, your participate in things like sarcasm, name calling, glaring, talking down, yelling, and all other forms of negativity. You feel as if you are engaged in a battle. You think about your relationship in terms of "winning" and "losing," of "standing your ground" and "giving up." These conflicts are rarely resolved in a way which leaves you and your partner feeling satisfied and closer to one another. Generally, they just fizzle out and you never talk about them again.

Conflicts like these are unproductive. Instead of bringing you closer in your partnership, each conflict takes you two steps backward. And the longer you handle your conflicts this way, the deeper you fall into a vicious cycle. You develop negative feelings about your partner. You feel that they actually "want" to hurt you or that they don't care about you at all. You have many unhealed injuries and tensions in your home are quick to escalate. You know that another bad conflict is going to happen sooner or later.

Of course you're always trying your best to communicate with your partner. But once you're caught up in a vicious cycle, it's very hard to get out. You try and say how you feel but the message just does not get through to your partner. They brush you off, belittle you, or even get angry at you for trying to communicate clearly.

If this goes on long enough, you might think about leaving your partner. But if you can't or won't or shouldn't, you end up feeling trapped and frustrated. In the end you just resign yourself to the idea that things will never get better. That's your life and there's no use rocking the boat.

As much as you want to act nonchalant about your relationship problems, we both know that poor conflict resolution is a significant stress on your life. For one thing, your partner never learns to treat you the way that you want to be treated. How can you relax knowing that your partner might invade your boundaries at any second. For another thing, you never learn how to avoid the same conflicts in the future. How can you relax knowing that anything you say or do might explode a whole new conflict. And most importantly, you and your partner never get the chance to take back the mean things you've said and done. How can you feel safe around someone who has hurt you so many times and will certainly hurt you again? That is not a healthy way to live.

The truth is that you don't have to live this way. Your relationship can be better and it will get better with my help. Communication is hard and you've failed many times in the past. But back then, you didn't have any tools.

When you're doing any job, you need the right tools. If you're trying to pull a 4 inch nail that's 3 inches deep in a piece of wood, you don't use your fingers. You get a hammer. If you want to lift a car, you could never do it with your own muscles. But a jack makes it easy.

And if you want to resolve a conflict, your intuition doesn't always serve you well. But I'm going to provide you with tools that make every conflict more productive. I'm going to show you exactly the do's and don'ts. I'll teach you how to set strict boundaries while never crossing over your partners. You will learn how to express how you feel, bring out the best in your partner, and get treated the way you deserve to be treated. Of course, you can only change your own behavior. But if you follow my advice, you will feel better at the end of a conflict, no matter what your parter does.

The Program
===========
----------------
Acknowledgements
----------------
You are here to improve your own life.
The first step of this program is to acknowledge that you are here to improve your own life. You're not here to be nice, you're not here to do the right thing, you're not here to be a martyr. Human beings are extremely sensitive creatures and our relationships are everything to us. Acknowledge that the poor communication in your relationship hurts you and you deserve better. This is the most certain way to become happier and healthier in your life.

You can't change your partner.
Come to terms with the fact you can't change your partner. Nobody has that power. Your partner may never get the message and may always stay angry and confused. You are learning how to set your own healthy boundaries and respect your partner's boundaries for your own sake. This way of living will improve your life even if your partner never changes their ways. To some extent, your partner will have no choice but to treat you better. By your own actions you will feel better, and you will treat yourself better.

You are part of the problem.
Come to terms with the fact that you are not perfect. Nobody is perfect, you are no exception. You are a good person and you are always trying your best. But you have a temper, you get negative, you don't listen. You might argue that your partner is the bigger part of the problem. That your partner is more mean, negative, and unrespesponsive. That may be true, but that doesn't change the fact that there are apologies you deserve to give and changes that you need to make about your own behavior. Learn to admit that you're wrong.

The good technique works.
In the following pages you might think that I'm asking you to be "nice" to your partner. You might not like this idea. You might say "If my partner is disrespecting and hurting me, why should I be nice?" We are not following this program because we want to be nice. We're following it because it works.
In the following pages you might think that I'm asking you to admit defeat. You might say "if I just let my partner win, then they'll walk all over me." The reality is the opposite. Negativity in a relationship signals weakness. The strongest upper hand you can ever gain on another person is by treating them with respect and kindness. Even if someone is very abusive, even if they are crazy, you don't gain anything by crossing the line and acting ugly to them. Even if you have to leave comeone, even if you have to call the cops or put them in a headlock, you are doing so with compassion and understanding at the front of your mind.

The good technique is not infallible.
Throughout this program you are going to find every reason imaginable to doubt, deflect, and throw in the towel. Resist this temptation. Relationships don't change overnight. It takes three months to potty train a dog. Your human relationship will take even more time. But even the smallest steps of progress are a huge relief.

(You are doing the right thing)

A Healthy Relationship
----------------------
Many of us live our entire lives without ever participating in a deeply healthy relationship or without seeing a healthy relationship to model after. We get a lot of our relationship information from what we see on TV or read in books. This leaves us with a handicap. It is important to understand what a healthy relationship looks like so you know what to demand from your partner. It is also important to know what what lines you must not cross. The following are the rules for a healthy relationship:

1. You have no wrong feelings
2. Your feelings are not wrong even if they make your partner feel bad
3. Your feelings are important
4. You deserve to express your feelings
5. You can't change how you feel
6. You deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated
7. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. If you do anything, you should feel good about it
8. If you got hurt, you deserve an apology. You are the only one who knows if you got hurt
9. You don't need to tolerate abuse, even from a very sick/sad person
10. There is never any valid reason to threaten, belittle, attack, or disrespect. Even if your partner did the same things to you. If you did these things, then it's your job to apologize
11. You must have other relationships.
12. It's okay to break up

The rules for a healthy relationship are not just theoretical. They are talking points and places to stand your ground. Think of them as your Bill of Rights. Throughout your relationship, your partner is going to try to convince you that your relationship allows for some unhealthy exception.

For example, you partner might try to convince you that one of your feelings is a "wrong" feeling. They might say "You shouln't be jealous of me for spending time with my best friend. That's petty." Or "You shouldn't get angry at me for throwing out your old shirt. Grow up" The reality, or course, is that you have no wrong feelings. You can't turn your feelings off, and you shouldn't try to. Certainly, you shouldn't yell and call names because of your feelings. And you should try not to get hysterical. But that's different from having "wrong feelings".

This situation happens over and over. Your partner will relentlessly try to bend every rule of healthy relationships. Your partner will try to convince you: that your feelings don't matter on their birthday because they are the more important than you. Or that you shouldn't express your feelings because it's too painful to listen to you. Or that you have to have sex tonight because that's what you agreed to when you got married. Or that you don't deserve an apology because it happened so long in the past. Or that you screwed up dinner so that's why it was okay to call you stupid. The list could go on forever.

When this happens, you should rely on the rules for a healthy relationship. Trust them and don't back down. Say them to your partner with conviction:
1. I have no wrong feelings
2. My feelings are not wrong even if they make you feel bad
3. My feelings are important
4. I deserve to express my feelings
5. I can't change how I feel
6. I deserve to be treated the way I want to be treated
7. I don't have to do anything I don't want to do
8. I deserve an apology. I'm the only one who knows if I got hurt
9. I don't need to tolerate abuse
10. There's never a reason to disrespect me
11. I need to have other relationships
12. It's okay to break up

Conflict
========
99% of our time in a relationship is peaceful. Most of our activity is spent eating together, sitting together, going out, watching tv, brushing our teeth, and sleeping. When a conflict suddenly breaks out it doesn't last long, maybe an hour if that. But even though we only spend 1% of our time fighting, these moments are what determine the course of our relationships.

There are endless reasons for two people to fight. Money, politics, sex. Forgotten birthdays. Unwanted comments. Misunderstood anxiety. Your partner slurps their cheerios to loudly. You want to get to the show on time but your partner always make you late. Uncalled-for disrespect.

A conflict happens in 3 parts. They start out hot and gradually cool down.
1. The early  moments of a conflit are usually where the most damage is done. When a fight breaks out, you tend to yell, glare, and be generally negative. This negative behavior, even if it feel justified, is poisonous for your relationship.

2. The middle part of a conflict should contain a discussion. This is where you actually talk about the issue at hand in a neutral way. You talk about why your birthday matters so much to you or why you're always late for the show.

3. The last part of a conflict is the resolution. This is where you both get back onto the same page. Here you each apologize to one another for the negativity that happened along the way. You agree on what you each  expectat from your relationship. And you make an agreement about what you're each going to do differently moving forward.

How to Resolve a Conflict
The Basic Strategy
You and Dad are human beings. You are always going to get angry, you're always going to fight. The goal is:
1. To take the edge off of the fighting. Instead of fighting with bare knuckles, you'll fight with puffy gloves. 
2. Even while you're fighting, constantly remind Dad that you care about him. Even while you push Dad away, you want to simultaneously pull him back.

Basic Concepts
Monkey-See Monkey-Do
The golden rule says "treat others the way that you would like to be treated." This makes sense, in part, because other people learn to treat you exactly the way that you treat them. You need to "be" the change that you want to see in Dad. If you want Dad to be calm and understanding, then you have to model calm and understanding behavior. Don't make the mistake of thinking that you can get dad to be calm and understanding even though you're yelling and screaming. Think of this exercise as "hypnotizing" dad. Although you can't literally "change" Dad, your actions have a bigger affect than you realize.

Make the First Move
To improve your life, you'll want to get your partner to apologize, to treat you with respect, to attend to your needs, and ultimately to provide you with love and support. But you can't just demand apologies and respect out of the blue. If you want those things from your partner, you're going to have to make the first move. This means you're going to have to make yourself a little bit vulnerable, uncomfortable, and open to criticism. You're sometimes going to have to stir the pot and open up old wounds. And you're always going to try to be the bigger person.

In Times of Peace
Say "I Care About You"
You need to establish positive feelings toward each other. Freak mom out one day by looking her in the eyes and saying "I care about you Sue." If that's too big a step, send her a text message that says "I care about you Sue." If that's too big a step, just buy her flowers. Or a get her a card.

No matter what you say, the point is to make mom feel that you care about her. Make her feel that she is a human being and that she matters in this world. This is essential for any functional relationship. If mom feels that you don't care about her, why should she be nice to you? Would you be nice to someone who doesn't give a damn about you?
But if you can make mom believe that you care about her, then she will treat you better. If she becomes convinced that you care about her, she will lose her inclination to disrespect you and will be open to changing her behavior. In addition, 90% of all the snapping at you that mom does is perceived self-defense. If mom doesn't feel that you hate her, she won't need to defend herself from you. 

This is by far the easiest way to create peace in your home. If you do this on a regular basis, your conflicts will become significantly more peaceful and a significant number of conflicts will be avoided altogether.

You might object "but I don't feel that way toward her any more. We've been through too many bad things." I know that you don't feel passionate for Mom these days. I know you're not sure that you even love her or if you want to be buried next to her. But the fact of the matter is that you live together. You spend time together. You're married. You loved each other once. You spent 30 years together. Like it or not, you care about her. Human beings care about the people they are close to.

If you don't feel honest saying "I love you," then don't say it. You should only ever speak from the heart. But if you dig deep, you will always find some phrase that lets your partner know that they are more than a stranger to you. Say "you are important to me" or "I care about how you feel" or "I want you to be happy" or "You are my wife and my partner." Saying something earnest like this will probably not feel comfortable. That's fine. If anything, feeling a little uncomfortable means you're on the right track.

Don't skip this step. There are no unimportant steps in this book. Once you choose your positive phrase, we're going to reuse it over and over throughout the following techniques.


Apologize
Over the years you and Mom have had many hundreds of conflicts. Regardless of who was wrong or right, those conflicts left both of you feeling hurt and confused. To this day, you and Mom still carry those hurt feelings inside of you. And with those hurt feelings you each also carry negative feelings toward each other.

While you can't change history and you can't erase those hurt feelings, there is something useful that you can do: apologize. We teach children to apologize when they get into a fight. Why should it be any different for adults?

Go ahead an apologize any time of day. An apology doesn't have to be elaborate or elagant. While you're standing around in the kitchen or just after you get home from work, just come out and say "I want to apologize for the last time we argued." Or try "I know I'm not always that nice. So, I'm sorry." Maybe there's something specific that you want to apologize for. For example, you might say "I'm sorry that I told you that you're fat and that you're a cold fish" or "I'm sorry for losing my temper and breaking one of our vases."

The point of this exercise isn't to find the precise right words. It's simply to apologize and to mean it. Think back to the negative things that you said to Mom. Feel rightfully sad that you said those things. Now, put those feelings into words and aplogize.

An apology works very well for several reasons. By apologizing to Mom, you show that you care about her. After years of conflict, Mom has started to think that you don't care about her. She feels that, when the two of you fight, you say negative things purely because you don't like her. By apologizing, you correct Mom's negative line of thinking. You are telling her that you do care about her, that you don't want her to feel hurt, and that you are willing to humble yourself to make her feel better. This establishes the prescedent that Mom is your priority and reinforces her belief that the two of you are on a team.

Apologizing also makes you nonthreatening. Over the years Mom has come to see you as an antagonist. When she pictures you in her mind, many of her memories involve you doing and saying negative things to her. What's worse, she feels that you are proud of your negative behavior and that you intend to hurt her again. But when you apologize, you show Mom that you are aware of your negative behavior and that you are not proud of it. You clarify that you don't do negative things because you enjoy it, you do it because you're a human being and you are imperfect. Most importantly, it let's Mom know that you want to do better.

By letting Mom know that you want to do better, you are, little by little, bringing mom onto your "team." Currently, your temper is something that you dealt with on your own. It is something that you both live with, but didn't talk about openly. By apologizing, your temper becomes a project that you and Mom work on together. You can come up with strategies together about how to avoid a fight when your get angry.

As a result of your apology, your own life will improve.
For one thing, Mom will treat you better. She will have more patience and more willing to agree with you. She will be more willing to compromise and happier to do you favors. You will find her smiling at you more, complimenting you, and encouraging you. When you express a need to her, she will be more inclined to listen. She will become more proactive and attentive to your needs. If you are the sort of person who likes to receive gifts, she will tend to bring you gifts. If you are the sort of person who needs to be physically touched, you fill find her touching you more frequently. If you need to hear words of praise, you will find her praising and appreciating you. Even the first signs of this positivity from Mom will quickly remind you how valuable it is to be in a healthy relationship.

On the other hand, your apology will also make Mom less negative. You will find her less likely to snap and to criticize. She will be less defensive and prickly. She will not feel good about disrespecting or belittling you. She will be less inclined to raise her voice, less willing to mock you, less likely to call you names.

Finally, by apologizing to Mom, she is much more likely to apologize to you. This is the final and most important benefit of apologizing to Mom. 

Objections
You might say "But what if it's not the right time to apologize? What if it's too soon? What if it's too late? What if I just come across sounding stupid?" It's easy to come up with reasons why you shouldn't do the right thing. But do we teach children to wait for the perfect moment to spring an apology? No, we tell them to apologize immediately. The fact of the matter is that most people like it when you apologize to them. 9 times out of 10, the apology will work like magic. 

You might still object "but what if I'm opening up old wounds?" It's true, apologizing for a conflict that's already over with can turn a peaceful evening into a tense one. But the fact of the matter is that those wounds aren't healed an gone. You may not notice them, but you haven't apologized yet for negative things you did, then Mom is still hurting deep down. If you really think that the apology will do more good, then you don't have to apologize. I trust your judgement. But don't make a habit out it. You're best off making a personal principle out of apologizing early and often.

Finally, you might object the premise of making the first move. You might say "Why should I be the one to apologize? Mom hurt me too. Let her apologize first." You're right, it's not fair. You deserve to an apology just as much as Mom does, if not more. But this book isn't about pure fairness, it's about how to improve your own life. And if you want to have a happy life, get used to being the bigger person.

Ask for an Apology
Over the years you and Mom have had many hundreds of conflicts. Regardless of who was wrong or right, those conflicts left both of you feeling hurt and confused. To this day, you still carry those hurt feelings inside of you. And along with those hurt feelings you carry negative feelings toward Mom.

You are a human being. Just like mom, you carry around hurt feelings which affect your self-esteem. Even if you did and said negative things, you still deserve and apology for the negative things that Mom did and said to you. The apology will make you feel good; it will make you feel important and cared for. It will work wonders for your self-esteem and you outlook on life in general.

Go ahead and ask for an apology any time of day. While you're standing around in the kitchen or just after you get home from work, just come out and say "I don't feel good about the last time we argued. I'd like an apology please." Or try "I know I'm not always that nice. But I feel like I deserve an apology" Maybe there's something specific that you want to apologize for. For example, you might say "I still feel bad because you told me that I'm fat and that I'm a cold fish" or "I want you to apologize to me for losing your temper and breaking one of our vases."

As a rule, you should try not to ask for an apology unless you've already apologized yourself. This is not because you don't deserve an apology as much as Dad (you definitely do). You apologize first because this will soften Dad up and give you the best chance of success. For the sake of your own happiness, get used to making the first move and being the bigger person.

Body Language

Objections
Even if you've already apologized to Dad, he will probably resist apologizing to you. Nobody wants to admit they've done anything wrong, humble themselves or feel vulnerable. By asking Dad to apologize he might get defensive, and maybe even get angry.

In that case you might say: "why should I ask for an apology if it's only going to make Dad angry? I don't need an apology that badly." The fact is that you deserve an apology. A healthy relationship is a two-way street with no room for martyrdom. You don't avoid that road just because it's bumpy. You drive that road back and forth until it flattens out. If Dad resists apologizing or gets defenseive, you calmly ride it out until your message gets through.

Dad might try to tell you "I don't need to apologize because I didn't say anything wrong." The fact is that you Dad doesn't get to decide whether he said anything wrong. In a healthy relationship, he should attend to your feelings purely because you feel them. Say to him "I am the only one who knows if I got hurt. If I feel hurt then I deserve an apology." Dad might try to tell you that you are being too sensitive. He might say "you shouldn't feel bad just because I called you a cold fish. It was only a joke." Stand up for your feelings even if they don't make sense to Dad. Say "Even if it was a joke, I still feel bad. It's okay for me to be sensitive. If I feel bad then I deserve an apology."

Dad might try to say "I don't need to apologize because you were the one who was wrong. You said mean things to me." Remind Dad that conflict isn't a competition. It's not a game of absolute right and wrong. Go ahead and acknowledge that you did the wrong thing: "I'm sorry that I said mean things to you. I am not proud of what I did." But insist that you deserve an apology too: "But my feelings were hurt too. I am a good person. If my feelings were hurt, then I deserve an apology."

Be persistent. Dad will do everything he can to avoid apologizing. If it looks like the situation is getting heated, take a break to let things cool down. Wait until the next day. Or next week. In the end, you might see that Dad isn't going to give you the apology you require. You might have to accept that and move on. But don't let that discourage you the next time you have a conflict. By demanding that your relationship follow healthy rules, you are not being selfish. You are making a serious investment in your own happiness and in your partner's happiness.

Recap
When you are dealing with Dad, especially when you are standing up for your rights it's important to 1. Focus on yourself and 2. Be positive.
After all these years of conflict, Dad is defensive. He is able automatically see anything you say or do as an attack. So, avoid statements that focus on Dad and begin with the word "you." For example, try not to say "YOU don't think my feelings are important" and "YOU just want to hurt my feelings." These statements feed Dad's preconceived belief that you are out to attack him and make sure that he become defensive right away. That's why we use "I" statements. It's better to say "My feelings are important" or "If my feelings were hurt, I deserve an apology." These statements frame the conflict in a healthy way by taking the focus off of Dad an putting it where it belongs: on you and your feelings. You have no interest in putting Dad down and criticizing him just for fun. All you want is a respectful and healthy relationship.

You also want to avoid negative statements. Saying "I hate this relationship" or "I'm the only one who does any work around here" is not going to bring Dad onto your team. It's better to use positive statements such as "we are a team" and "I am a good person." These statements catch Dad off guard. In Dad's mind a conflict is not about feelings, it is about fighting and winning. By reframing the conflict, he will be less likely to resort to his automatically defensive responses. Slowly, you will teach Dad that conflict is not about coming out on top, it's about coming together.

Hypnosis
Positive statements are not only good for calming down a situation, they also give you the opportunity to "hypnotize" Dad. Right now, Dad spends a lot of time acting negative, defensive, and bad-tempered. Wouldn't you be happier if he acted positive, open, and calm? You can affect Dad's personality by treating him like person you want him to be. If you treat Dad like a villain, he will act like a villain. So if you say "you just like to see me suffer," Dad will start taunting you and calling you names. But, deep down, everyone wants to feel like a hero. So if say "I know that you care about my feelings," he will soften up and become receptive to your feelings. If you say  "you never do any work around here," he will immediately lay on the couch. But if say "you work hard for our family and I appreciate that," he will be much more inclined to pick up the slack.

(At first he might be skeptical: "I'm a good person too! You're not the only good person!" This is ther perfect opportunity. Say "Yes, you are a good person. You are a good husband who takes care of me." He might get mean: "I don't want to be on your team!" Don't let his negativity throw off your technique. Reply "well, I want to be on your team. You are important to me and I care about you")

Getting Angry
Sometimes, Dad does something that irritates you. For example, he makes you late to the show by waiting until the last minute to get ready. You deserve to tell him that it's not fair for him to make you both late; that he's making you feel disrespected and unimportant. He might even start criticizing you and calling you names.

It's your job to say how you feel. But the important thing is to not be negative. You must avoid all attitudes and words that would hurt Dad's feelings. This means no sarcasm, no yelling, no accusations, no namecalling, no glaring, no bug eyes, no clenched fists, no pointing fingers.

The reason that you do not *act* negative, even if you feel negative, is because acting negative will only inflame the situation. When a dog barks in the house, you don't respond by yelling even louder than the dog. That would only rile the dog up more. In the same way, if dad irritates you, you don't respond with anger and irritation. That's only going to rile dad up and make him want to disrespect you.

You might say "so what am I supposed to do, just let dad walk all over me?" No, of course not. Instead you let dad know that you're not okay with his behavior without being negative. For this purpose, you use somethign called an "I" statement. An "I" statement is a statement about yourself; not about dad. Typically, such statements start with something like "I feel," "I want," "I like," et cetera. For example, you tell dad "It feel bad when we're late to the show." Or "It hurts my feelings when you yell at me."
An I statement works best when you talk about your feelings. The more silly you feel, the more you sound like a little kid, the better. It's always great to say "you're hurting my feelings." It's always great to say "please" as in "please don't yell at me." I like saying "It makes me sad" or "I feel bad" or "I don't feel good about this."
An I statement works poorly when you focus too much on dad's wrongdoings or use the opportunity to say negative things. It's unproductive to say "It hurts my feelings when you treat me like shit," or "I feel bad that you only care about yourself." In that case, dad is going to get defensive. These statements sound like they're about you, but they contain negative judgements about dad. It's better to stick to the facts: "It hurts my feelings when you forget my birthday" or "I feel bad when you criticize me in front of my family."

An I statement works for several reasons. The most important reason that an I statement works is because it gets to the heart of the issue. You. Your feelings. Dad (like all people) thinks that every situation is about himself. He thinks that the only reason you're criticizing him is to put him down. When you use "I" statements, you are insisting "this isn't about you. I'm not here to put you down. All I want is to get to show on time and to feel that I am respected"
For another thing, "I" statement humanize; they make you appear nonthreatening. After all these years of struggle with dad, he's come to to see himself as a big victim and you as a big antagonist. Dad is capable of responding to almost anything you do or say as you are threatening or criticizing him. But when you act like a little kid and say "It hurts my feelings" it catches dad off guard. He is more likely to take responsibility for his actions if he cam be confinced that he's hurt your feelings.

Throughout this process you might say "this isn't fair. If dad is going to disrespect me, why should I act calm and be nice?" You're right, it's not fair. You deserve to be treated with respect and understanding. But if you want to have a happy life and a happy relationship, you're going to have to get used to being the bigger person.

What if Being Calm Doesn't Work?
You might be all on board with the techniques in the last section. You want to be calm and say how you feel. But what if Dad isn't on board? What if you are sweet and calm and say things like "It hurts my feelings when we're late for the show" but Dad keeps on doing the things that hurt your feelings.
For this situation, you your tool is to use Persistence. Being positive doesn't mean that you have to be a pushover. Be adamant that you must be treated the way that you want to be treated. Continue to repeat phrases like "I don't feel good about this situation." And "I want you to respect how I feel."
When Dad does something that hurts your feelngs, you need to see your hurt feelings as a priority in your life. You may be tempted to ignore those feelings for the sake of returning to the status quo, but that will only feed the tension beneath the surface of your relationship. You deserve an Apology and a Resolution. If you have the time, insist that ou want to continue talking about the issue. If you don't have the time, make it clear that you want to talk about the issue in the future.
You may not be able to get Dad to apologize and resolve the issue the first time. He might try to avoid the discussion for days and days. But eventually, he's going to have no choice but to face you as a human being. This is what you want. You want dad to invest himself in a conversation about your feelings. This might manifest itself as an angry fight. But if it's a fight you need to have, then it's worth getting it over with so you can move closer in your relationship.

Boundaries

Every conflict is about boundaries. Boundaries are an essential part of any relationship. Any time you make a clear distinction between what you are okay with and what you are not you are setting a boundary.

During a conflict 

A conflict is as if you're driving a race car.

 
Strict boundaries are essential
You must not let your boundaries get crossed
You must not cross your partner's boundaries
Your goal is to stay in the middle

Elvis didn't call to schedule 2 payments and now they had to pay a ton after their car got repossessed. Sure. he did the wrong thing. But the point isn't to yell and tell him how bad he is until he decides to be good again. 1. You reality check the man if he needs one. 2. you figure out what needs to change in his life (the reality check is probably related)


 I'm going to get you to look at the play-by-play of what happens in a conflict. I'm going to show you examples of healthy and unhealthy conflicts. We'll look at techniques

 you and your partner can both live a happier life together. As long as you're planning to live together, you owe it to yourself to try to handle your conflicts better. Whatever effort you put into your relationship, you will get back double in the reduction of stress and quadrouple in the understanding and warmth that your partner gives to you. It's doable and it's worth the effort.

And here's why it's doable. The truth is that deep down you and your partner care about each other very much. When two people spend years and decades together, that's what happens, there's no avoiding it. You might not feel like you care about each other, but you do many acts of service for your partner every day which show that you really do. You certainly don't want to hurt each other and you don't want your relationship to be a battlefield or a power struggle.

So then why do you fight? Because you are SENSITIVE PEOPLE caught up in a vicious cycle. All you want to is to be cared for and respected to and treated the way that you want to be treated. And what you'll find is that, as soon as your partner starts to treat you with respect and show interest in your feelings, all positive feelings toward your partner will start flooding back.


A Relationship
A relationship is must more than companionship and love. A human being needs a partner to get by. You need someone who can understand how you feel and help interpret it for you.

As a team, you are contantly working to solve each other's problems. If there's something bothering you in your life, you put that feeling into words, and then you say those words. Although your privacy is your right to keep, there should be no feeling that you can't share with your parnter.

What if your partner doesn't like how you feel? What if you need to tell your partner that you don't enjoy spending time with their mother? Or that you think all the time about quitting your job? Your partner may be unhappy. Your feelings may change the dynamic of your relationship. They may not be able to enjoy things you used to do together. Your partner may be defensive at first, scared, or angry. But ultimately, your partner knows that you did the right thing by saying how you feel.
