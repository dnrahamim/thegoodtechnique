The Good Technique

Summary

This is about conflict resolution. How to have more productive less painful conflicts.

=====
Intro
=====
Conflict is unavoidable in a relationship. People get grumpy, get under each other's skin, and have disagreements. It's commonly believed that conflict is a purely bad thing. After all, nobody likes getting grumpy and arguing. Some people try to avoid conflict altogether. But even though conflicts are painful, they do serve a productive purpose.

Typicially we keep our true feelings to ourselves. Conflict provides an opportunity for you and your partner get your true feelings out on the table. By the end of a conflict, you should reach a resolution where you and your partner agree on new terms which will prevent the same situation from breaking out in the future. When it's over, you should both feel closer and more understanding of one another.

Of course, this is not how most conflicts go down. In the real world, conflict means anger, guilt, and hurt feelings. When you and your partner have conflict, your participate in things like sarcasm, name calling, glaring, talking down, yelling, and all other forms of negativity. You feel as if you are engaged in a battle. You think about your relationship in terms of "winning" and "losing," of "standing your ground" and "giving up." These conflicts are rarely resolved in a way which leaves you and your partner feeling satisfied and closer to one another. Generally, they just fizzle out and you never talk about them again.

Conflicts like these are unproductive. Instead of bringing you closer in your partnership, each conflict takes you two steps backward. And the longer you handle your conflicts this way, the deeper you fall into a vicious cycle. You develop negative feelings about your partner. You feel that they actually "want" to hurt you or that they don't care about you at all. You have many unhealed injuries and tensions in your home are quick to escalate. You know that another bad conflict is going to happen sooner or later.

Of course you're always trying your best to communicate with your partner. But once you're caught up in a vicious cycle, it's very hard to get out. You try and say how you feel but the message just does not get through to your partner. They brush you off, belittle you, or even get angry at you for trying to communicate clearly.

If this goes on long enough, you might think about leaving your partner. But if you can't or won't or shouldn't, you end up feeling trapped and frustrated. In the end you just resign yourself to the idea that things will never get better. That's your life and there's no use rocking the boat.

As much as you want to act nonchalant about your relationship problems, we both know that poor conflict resolution is a significant stress on your life. For one thing, your partner never learns to treat you the way that you want to be treated. How can you relax knowing that your partner might invade your boundaries at any second. For another thing, you never learn how to avoid the same conflicts in the future. How can you relax knowing that anything you say or do might explode a whole new conflict. And most importantly, you and your partner never get the chance to take back the mean things you've said and done. How can you feel safe around someone who has hurt you so many times and will certainly hurt you again? That is not a healthy way to live.

The truth is that you don't have to live this way. Your relationship can be better and it will get better with my help. Communication is hard and you've failed many times in the past. But back then, you didn't have any tools.

When you're doing any job, you need the right tools. If you're trying to pull a 4 inch nail that's 3 inches deep in a piece of wood, you don't use your fingers. You get a hammer. If you want to lift a car, you could never do it with your own muscles. But a jack makes it easy.

And if you want to resolve a conflict, your intuition doesn't always serve you well. But I'm going to provide you with tools that make every conflict more productive. I'm going to show you exactly the do's and don'ts. I'll teach you how to set strict boundaries while never crossing over your partners. You will learn how to express how you feel, bring out the best in your partner, and get treated the way you deserve to be treated. Of course, you can only change your own behavior. But if you follow my advice, you will feel better at the end of a conflict, no matter what your parter does.

The Program
===========
----------------
Acknowledgements
----------------
You are here to improve your own life.
The first step of this program is to acknowledge that you are here to improve your own life. You're not here to be nice, you're not here to do the right thing, you're not here to be a martyr. Human beings are extremely sensitive creatures and our relationships are everything to us. Acknowledge that the poor communication in your relationship hurts you and you deserve better. This is the most certain way to become happier and healthier in your life.

You can't change your partner.
Come to terms with the fact you can't change your partner. Nobody has that power. Your partner may never get the message and may always stay angry and confused. You are learning how to set your own healthy boundaries and respect your partner's boundaries for your own sake. This way of living will improve your life even if your partner never changes their ways. To some extent, your partner will have no choice but to treat you better. By your own actions you will feel better, and you will treat yourself better.

The good technique works.
In the following pages you might think that I'm asking you to be "nice" to your partner. You might not like this idea. You might say "If my partner is disrespecting and hurting me, why should I be nice?" We are not following this program because we want to be nice. We're following it because it works.
In the following pages you might think that I'm asking you to admit defeat. You might say "if I just let my partner win, then they'll walk all over me." The reality is the opposite. Negativity in a relationship signals weakness. The strongest upper hand you can ever gain on another person is by treating them with respect and kindness. Even if someone is very abusive, even if they are crazy, you don't gain anything by crossing the line and acting ugly to them. Even if you have to leave comeone, even if you have to call the cops or put them in a headlock, you are doing so with compassion and understanding at the front of your mind.

The good technique is not infallible.
Throughout this program you are going to find every reason imaginable to doubt, deflect, and throw in the towel. Resist this temptation. Relationships don't change overnight. It takes three months to potty train a dog. Your human relationship will take even more time. But even the smallest steps of progress are a huge relief.

(You are doing the right thing)

A Healthy Relationship
----------------------
Many of us live our entire lives without ever participating in a deeply healthy relationship or without seeing a healthy relationship to model after. This leaves us with a handicap. It is important to understand what a healthy relationship looks like so you know what to demand from your partner. It is also important to know what what lines you must not cross. The following are the rules for a healthy relationship:

1. You have no wrong feelings
2. Your feelings are not wrong even if they make your partner feel bad
3. Your feelings are important
4. You deserve to express your feelings
5. You can't change how you feel
6. You deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated
7. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. If you do anything, you should feel good about it
8. If you got hurt, you deserve an apology. You are the only one who knows if you got hurt
9. You don't need to tolerate abuse, even from a very sick/sad person
10. There is never any valid reason to threaten, belittle, attack, or disrespect. Even if your partner did the same things to you. If you did these things, then it's your job to apologize
11. It's okay to break up

Conflict
========
99% of our time in a relationship is peaceful. Most of our activity is spent eating together, sitting together, going out, watching tv, brushing our teeth, and sleeping. When a conflict suddenly breaks out it doesn't last long. But even though we only spend 1% of our time fighting, these moments are what determine the course of our relationships.

During the 99% of our relationship spent going through the motions of life, we build up tension. We are slowly figuring out what we are not okay with. When tensions erupt, it is not because we are fighting for the fun of it. We fight because we have something important that we are trying to tell each other.


----------
Boundaries
----------
Every conflict is about boundaries. Boundaries are an essential part of any relationship. Any time you make a clear distinction between what you are okay with and what you are not you are setting a boundary.

During a conflict 

A conflict is as if you're driving a race car.

 
Strict boundaries are essential
You must not let your boundaries get crossed
You must not cross your partner's boundaries
Your goal is to stay in the middle

Shame and Punishment

Elvis didn't call to schedule 2 payments and now they had to pay a ton after their car got repossessed. Sure. he did the wrong thing. But the point isn't to yell and tell him how bad he is until he decides to be good again. 1. You reality check the man if he needs one. 2. you figure out what needs to change in his life (the reality check is probably related)


 I'm going to get you to look at the play-by-play of what happens in a conflict. I'm going to show you examples of healthy and unhealthy conflicts. We'll look at techniques

 you and your partner can both live a happier life together. As long as you're planning to live together, you owe it to yourself to try to handle your conflicts better. Whatever effort you put into your relationship, you will get back double in the reduction of stress and quadrouple in the understanding and warmth that your partner gives to you. It's doable and it's worth the effort.

And here's why it's doable. The truth is that deep down you and your partner care about each other very much. When two people spend years and decades together, that's what happens, there's no avoiding it. You might not feel like you care about each other, but you do many acts of service for your partner every day which show that you really do. You certainly don't want to hurt each other and you don't want your relationship to be a battlefield or a power struggle.

So then why do you fight? Because you are SENSITIVE PEOPLE caught up in a vicious cycle. All you want to is to be cared for and respected to and treated the way that you want to be treated. And what you'll find is that, as soon as your partner starts to treat you with respect and show interest in your feelings, all positive feelings toward your partner will start flooding back.
