This is about conflict resolution. How to have more productive less painful conflicts.

Conflict is unavoidable in a relationship. People get grumpy, get under each other's skin, and have disagreements. It's commonly believed that conflict is a purely bad thing. After all, nobody likes getting grumpy and arguing. Some people try to avoid conflict altogether. But even though conflicts are painful, they do serve a productive purpose.

Typicially we keep our true feelings to ourselves. Conflict provides an opportunity for you and your partner get your true feelings out on the table. By the end of a conflict, you should reach a resolution where you and your partner agree on new terms which will prevent the same situation from breaking out in the future. When it's over, you should both feel closer and more understanding of one another.

Of course, this is not how most conflicts go down. In the real world, conflict means anger, guilt, and hurt feelings. When you and your partner have conflict, your participate in things like sarcasm, name calling, glaring, talking down, yelling, and all other forms of negativity. You feel as if you are engaged in a battle. You think about your relationship in terms of "winning" and "losing," of "standing your ground" and "giving up." These conflicts are rarely resolved in a way which leaves you and your partner feeling satisfied and closer to one another. Generally, they just fizzle out and you never talk about them again.

Conflicts like these are unproductive. Instead of brining you closer and a partnership, each conflict takes you two steps backward. And the longer you handle your conflicts this way, the deeper you fall into a vicious cycle. You develop negative feelings about your partner. You feel that they actually "want" to hurt you or that they don't care about you at all. You have many unhealed injuries and tensions are quick to escalate. You know for sure that another bad conflict is going to happen sooner or later.

Of course you're always trying your best to communicate with your partner. But once you're caught up in a vicious cycle, it's very hard to get out. You try and say how you feel but the message just does not get through to your partner. They brush you off, belittle you, or even get angry at you for trying to communicate clearly.

If this goes on long enough, you might think about leaving your partner. But if you can't or won't or shouldn't, you end up feeling trapped and frustrated. In the end you just resign yourself to the idea that things will never get better. That's your life and there's no use rocking the boat.

As much as you want to act nonchalant about your relationship problems, but we both know that poor conflict resolution is a significant stress on your life. For one thing, your partner never learns to treat you the way that you want to be treated. How can you relax knowing that your partner might invade your boundaries at any second. For another thing, you never learn how to avoid the same conflicts in the future. How can you relax knowing that anything you say or do might explode a whole new conflict. And most importantly, you and your partner never get the chance to take back the mean things you've said and done. How can you feel safe around someone who has hurt you so many times and will certainly hurt you again? That is not a healthy way to live.

The truth is that you don't have to live this way. Your relationship can be better and it will get better with my help. Communication is hard and you've failed many times in the past. But back then, you didn't have any tools.

When you're doing any job, you need the right tools. If you're trying to pull a 4 inch nail that's 3 inches deep in a piece of wood, you don't use your fingers. You get a hammer. If you want to lift a car, you could never do it with your own muscles. But a jack makes it easy.

And if you want to resolve a conflict, your intuition doesn't always serve you well. But I'm going to provide you with tools that make every conflict more productive. I'm going to show you exactly the do's and don'ts. I'll teach you how to set strict boundaries while never crossing over your partners. You will learn how to experss how you feel, bring out the best in your partner, and get treated the way you deserve to be treated. Of course, you can only change your own behavior; you can't actually change your partner. But if you follow my advice, you will feel better at the end of a conflict, no matter what your parter does.

It's doable and it's worth the effort.

And here's why it's doable. The truth is that deep down you and your partner care about each other very much. When two people spend years and decades together, that's what happens, there's no avoiding it. You might not feel like you care about each other, but you do many acts of service for your partner every day which show that you really do. You certainly don't want to hurt each other and you don't want your relationship to be a battlefield or a power struggle.
