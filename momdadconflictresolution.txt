Preface
=======
The times in my life that I've felt happy and strong - I've had close and safe relationships. The times that I've felt confused and scared - I was alone. No other variables have ever mattered.

When I get scared, everything goes dark. I scream and struggle. But when a gentle person appears, the fear goes away. It feels the way it must feel when people find God.

Sometimes, when I am isolated from other people, I become so confused and scared that I lose control of my life. Eventually my friends and family save me. But then it starts again.

Once, when I was alone and out of control, my friends and family saved me. But this time around, something clicked. I saw how to make my relationships close and safe; permanently.

From this moment of clarity, I developed a technique for dealing with other people. My technique has bettered my life more rapidliy and intensely than I ever could have predicted. This handbook represents the core of my technique: the skill of Conflict Resolution. 

=====
Intro
=====
Conflict is unavoidable in a relationship. We get grumpy, get under each other's skin, and have disagreements. Sometimes they're quick and easy. Other times they are terrifying.

It is commonly believed that conflict is a bad thing. After all, nobody likes getting grumpy and arguing. Some people even try to avoid conflict altogether. This is a mistake.

Conflict serves a productive purpose. A relationship is a process of two people settling into one another. Imagine we are sitting on a couch with my elbow in your ribs. Conflict starts when you say "ow your elbow is in my ribs." And it ends when be both find a better way to sit. If handled well, each conflict should make us feel closer and more comfortable with one another.

Of course, conflicts do not usually go down so smoothly. In practice, conflict means anger, guilt, hurt feelings, sarcasm, name calling, glaring, talking down, yelling, door slamming, accusing, teeth grinding, and all other forms of negativity. It often feels as if we are fighting a war; not making peace. If anything, our fights just fizzle out and we never talk about them again.

Conflicts like these are destructive. Instead of bringing us closer in our partnership, each conflict takes us two steps backward. The longer we handle out conflicts this way, the more likely we are to fight again.

Even still, it is commonly assumed that unresolved conflict is part of a healthy relationship. In fact, many of us have never even seen one healthy resolution to a conflict. This is unacceptable. How can you relax knowing that I might invade your boundaries at any second? How can you be yourself knowing that anything you say or do might make me explode into anger? How can you feel safe when I've hurt you so many times, especially if I'll hurt you again? We deserve a better life than that.

We have the choice to make a better life for ourselves. Don't be discouraged just because our communication has failed in the past. But back then, we didn't have the right tools. Today we do.

===========
The Program
===========
In a nutshell, Conflict Resolution is about having Productive conflicts. It's not about being calm, being fair, or being nice (although these things are important). Go ahead and scream, make bug eyes, and make threats. Concflict Resolution only cares that the next fight is softer and further away.

This program follows the course of a typical fight. It begins with the Initial Outburst, continues through Saying how We Feel, proceeds to Apologizing, and ends with Making an Agreement. Along the way there are Techniques to study such as Disengaging and Talking like Child. We will address common Objections and discuss how to set healthy Boundaries.

----------------
Acknowledgements
----------------
Before we study the program, we need to emotionally prepare ourselves. We acknowledge a few things about ourselves and our relationship.

1. You are here to improve your own life.
You are learning the skill of Conflict Resolution in order to improve your own life. Not mine. My life is out of your hands. If your ability to be calm, respectful, and in-touch your feelings helps me out, that's a lucky bonus. But your study of Conflict Resolution is purely for its own sake.

2. You can't change me.
Even if you become a relationship guru, I may never change my ways. If I do change, it may take years or even decades. Don't count on it.

3. You are part of the problem.
You are not perfect. Nobody is perfect, you are no exception. You are a good person and you are always trying your best. But you have a temper, you get negative, you don't listen. You might argue that I (your partner) am the bigger part of the problem. Even if that's true, it's irrelevant to your personal study of Conlict Resolution.

4. Be positive. Don't be negative.
In the following pages you might notice that I'm asking you to be nice to me. You might not like this idea. You might say "If you're always disrespecting and hurting me, why should I be decent?" Because being decent works. The strongest upper hand you can ever gain on another person is by treating them with respect and kindness.

5. No technique is infallible.
Throughout this program you are going to find every reason imaginable to doubt, deflate, and throw in the towel. Resist this temptation. Relationships don't change overnight. It takes three months to potty train a dog. Our human relationship will take even more time. Hold out. Even the smallest steps of progress will be a huge relief.

6. No Technique is watertight.
Yes. You will need to interpret much of this handbook for yourself. Yes. A skilled Narcissist will always be able to take these words and use them against you. I'm sorry. But consider the alternative. Would such a person encourage you to read this handbook every morning? I think not. Study and be brave.

----------------------
A Healthy Relationship
----------------------
Many of us live our entire lives without ever participating in a deeply healthy relationship. Or seeing a healthy relationship to model ours after. Many of the gaps in our relationship education are filled by what we see on TV or read in books. This leaves us with a handicap. The following rules are intended to remedy that handicap.

Rules for a Healthy Relationship:
1. Your feelings are important.
2. You deserve to express your feelings.
3. You have no wrong feelings.
4. Your feelings are not wrong even if they make me (your partner) feel bad.
5. You can't change how you feel.
6. You deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated.
7. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
8. If you got hurt, you deserve an apology.
9. You don't need to tolerate abuse.
10. There is no valid reason for me to abuse you.
11. We must both have other relationships.
12. It's okay for us to break up.

The rules for a healthy relationship are not just theoretical. They places to stand your ground. Think of them as your Bill of Rights. Throughout our relationship, we will each try to argue that our relationship allows for some unhealthy exception to this Bill of Rights. But a healthy relationship has no exceptions. Mistakes, yes. Exceptions no.

========
Conflict
========
99% of the time in our relationship is spent in peaceful routine: eating together, sitting together, going out, watching tv, brushing our teeth, and sleeping. When a conflict suddenly breaks out it doesn't last long, maybe an hour if that. But even though we only spend 1% of our time fighting, these moments have the power to make or break our relationship.

There are endless reasons for two people to fight. Money, politics, sex, forgotten birthdays, unwanted comments, being too tired, being hungry, misunderstood anxiety, backseat driving, belittling, jealousy, crankiness, sarcasm, uncalled-for disrespect, unresolved grudges, unhealed trauma. I spill my drink all over the floor. You slurp your cheerios to loudly. I make an insentitive comment about your mother. You insist that I quit smoking. Pick any situation; two people have fought over it.

A prototypical conflict happens in the following order.

1. Dodge the Bullet.
A fight breaks out suddenly and forcefully. The early moments of a fight are where the most damage is done. We yell, glare, show our teeth, act negative, act aggressive. This negative behavior, even if it feels justified, is deeply poisonous for our relationship.

2. Say how you feel.
The fight cools down slightly. Now where we actually talk about the issue at hand. We sort out why my birthday matters so much to me and why you're always late for the show.

3. Aplogize.
We just said and did a lot of stuff that we regret. We need to apologize in order to feel close and safe. Only then can we use our logical brains.

4. Make an Agreement.
We might be at peace, but we still need to get onto the same page. Now we construct a strategy that will have us avoid the same conflict in the future. Then we make an agreement about what we're each going to do differently moving forward.

5. Repeat.

***********************
1. The Fight Breaks Out
***********************
A fight breaks out suddenly and forcefully. There's screaming, scowling, and disrespect. If there's one thing to learn about conflict resolution it's this: don't argue when you're angry.

===================
You Get Angry at Me
===================
Let's walk this program from your perspective (as opposed to mine). There are infinite ways that I can get under your skin. Sometimes I forget to scoop the kitty litter or water the plants. Sometimes I make you jealous by hanging out with coworkers of the opposite sex (or same sex). Sometimes I ignore you when you talk. Other times I correct every little thing you say. Sometimes I wake up grumpy and slam all the doors in the house. Other times we get into an argument about what groceries we can afford. Sometimes I'm just outright mean to you.

Take your pick. We've just exploded into a fight at the dinner table. What happens next?

----------------
Dodge the Bullet
----------------
So you're angry. Getting angry is a part of being alive, it's natural and right for you to get angry at me. But getting angry isn't really the problem.

The problem is that anger sets in quickly. A fight explodes like a bullet from a gun. In the split second that occurs  after one of us says "what the fuck did you just say?" either one of us is likely to lash out and make the situation much worse. Maybe you'll up the ante with "say that again asshole." Maybe I'll double down with "I'll say whatever I want you controlling bitch." We absolutely cannot go down that road. These responses are automatic. There's no time to think. Just dodge the bullet.

---------------------------
Technique: Go Extremely Low
---------------------------
This is our first technique, but it's one of them most difficult.

Anger is Hot. When you're suddenly very pissed, you're going to want to act hot. This means stomping on the gas, throwing whatever you're holding on to, break a glass, punch the wall, scream loud. These responses happen too fast to control. But you can make the best of things by going from Hot straight into Cold.

Instead of slamming on the gas, just drive Very. Very. Slow. Freakishly slow. Instead of throwing your computer, place it down Very. Very. Gently. Open the door and walk out with decision in every step. Make sure the world knows just how mad you are. Don't glare and act like a serial killer. Make it Harmless. But make it Huge.

This works because Cold and Hot are largely interchangable. Doing something freakishly cold scratches the same itch as insanely Hot. But Cold is better because it's safer and less threatening.

---------------------------
Technique: Anger to Sadness
---------------------------
Anger is Hot. Sadness is Cold.

As soon as you feel yourself starting to get angry, dive away from pure Anger straight into Sadness. This means that you deliberately change your facial expression from a glare to a frown. If you were imagining yourself yelling and jabbing your finger, picture yourself sobbing and hanging your head. This redirection of your anger is like rolling with a punch. Instead of blowing up, you will find yourself blowing... down.

I learned this technique by accident in my relationship with Shari Rose. We went through a rough patch where we glared and screamed at each other almost every day. But Shari is a very emotional person. Sometimes, when it felt like a fight was going to break out, Shari would crinkle up her face, throw herself on the couch, and become a shrieking harmless lump. I might have started out completely furious, but when I saw her reaction, I deflated like a balloon.

This works because anger and sadness are just two different expressions of the same feeling. Haven't you ever stubbed your toe so hard that you laugh and cry simultaneously? You will be surprised at how true and familiar the sadness feels. You might even find that it's much more real than your automatic anger.

------------------
A Note about Anger
------------------
Anger is dangerous. It makes us aggressive, illogical, and prone to attack. We might also start to think think that anger is a purely bad thing. This might also lead us to adopt the habit of bottling your anger up inside of you.

First off, don't bottle up your anger. Sooner or later, you will explode with much worse consequences for both of us. Second off, Anger is not purely bad, Anger is a part of being alive. It also serves the real-life purpose of letting us know that something is wrong.

What might be wrong? Perhaps I got picked on yesterday at school. Maybe I desperately need some quiet time. Maybe I'm developing the flu. Maybe I haven't gotten over my grandmother's death. All these things come out as Anger. It doesn't matter if I'm angry about something that happened 15 years ago or makes no obvious sense. I still have every right to feel angry and you have every reason to listen.

=============
1.5 Disengage
=============
The timeline of the fight has just begun. We dodged the initiall bullet by rolling from red Anger straight into blue Sadness. We've regained some of our ability to reason like adult human beings. But there's still plenty of rage left inside both of us. We have about 20 seconds worth of self-control until the next wave hits. We have to Disengage.

When you disengage, that means that you separate yourself from me. Leave the conversation, leave the room, cover your head with a blanket and sing happy birthday. Just find a way to be by yourself until you can calm down. You will find that, even when you are by yourself, you are furious! There will be a whole argument raging just inside of your own head. Stay by yourself, find a good distraction, and don't come out until the voices in your head turn into a dull hum.

Now that you're alone, take the opportunity to express yourself Hot and Horrible. Go ahead and scream, throw stuff, whack the desk with one of those wrapping paper tubes (they make a very lound and satisfying crack). Get the demons out.

Sometimes you are not in a position to easily leave the situation. Suppose you are driving and I realize that I left our tickets to the concert at home. You are furious. You can feel the desire to scream at me burning inside you. But you have nowhere to run; we're stuck together in a car and we're already going to be late to the show.

Don't prioritize anything above our relationship. Pull over, park, and leave the car until you calm down. It doesn't matter how late we are to the show; our relationship is all we've got.

----------
Objections
----------
You might object to the idea of calming down when you get angry. You might say "I have a good reason for being angry. You were singing at the top of your lungs at 10pm when I was trying to sleep! Why should I let you get away with it?" Or "I'm angry because you forgot my birthday! I've never forgotten your birthday once in my life. Why should I be a saint when you get to be careless?"

First of all, you're right. I screwed up. I'm disrespectful. I don't know how to control myself. But that's no reason to for you to sink down to my level. Your own life is best served by staying calm and being decent, no matter how bad my behavior is.

Secondly, you're not letting me "get away" with anything. By the end of this fight, you will make sure that I take responsibility for my actions. You must confront me about all of the ways that I hurt you during the course of our fight. You will say things like "you need to respect that I have work in the morning" or "my birthday matters to me and I need you to take that seriously." But you will do all of this without flying off the handle.

==================
I Get Angry at You
==================
There are many ways that you can get under my skin. Sometimes you have fun without inviting me, other times you leave your socks all over the house. You might make us late to the show by waiting until the last minute to get ready or eat the cupcake that my boss gave me. You might not be very supportive when I'm going through a tough time. You might trash-talk someone I care about.

----------------
Dodge the Bullet
----------------
When I get angry, it happens suddenly, like a bullet exploding from a gun. During this initial tantrum, I am not in my right state of mind - my logical mind is out to lunch while my body is controlled by a freaked-out goblin. And if you remain in my presence, I might try to hurt you. You must not allow yourself to get caught up in my tantrum.

---------
Disengage
---------
The only way to deflect my outburst is to disengage. This means that you break eye contact, leave the conversation, leave the room, leave the house. Wait a solid length of time and check to see if I'm calm and capable of rational thought. If I'm not ready to be rational, repeat the process until I am. This might only take a few minutes. Or it might last a few days. Be prepared to wait as long as it takes for me to calm down before you try to talk to me like a human being.

----------
Boundaries
----------
That said, waiting it out isn't so simple. May YOU want to postpone the fight, but that doesn't mean I'm on board. I'm going to try to bait you back into fighting. I'll yell at you, call you names, get bug eyes. I'll say "we're not having a dog and that's final" or "if you walk out that door you can forget about having thanksgiving here." I might even directly say "no, we are NOT waiting to have this fight! We're doing this right now!"

But no matter what trick I use or how irritating I become, don't take the bait. Say "no, I'm going downstairs" or "I"ll see you in 15 minutes" and walk out the door. You might say "I don't feel safe right now" or "I don't like the way this feels" as you turn around and go back to the car. Or just cover your head and dive under the blankets nervously muttering "no no no, I don't like this, I don't like this."

Whatever you do, find safety for yourself. Don't let me continue to make you feel uncomfortable. Go to the basement. Go in the bathroom. Sit with the family dog. You are in charge of you.

----------
Objections
----------
You might not like the idea of running away when I'm freaking out. You might say "so if you're yelling and calling me names, I'm just supposed to lie down and take it?" No. You don't lie down and take anything; you disenage. If you stood in my presence and allowed me to abuse you until I calmed down, that would be lying down and taking it. Don't do that.

You might not like the idea of running away without getting in the last word. You might say "if you call me an asshole, you'd better believe I'm gonna say it right back." Although you deserve to give me the same venom I give you; Don't. You gain nothing by attacking me. You don't teach me any lesson or assert your dominance. You just dig a deeper hole for both of us.

===================
2. Say How you Feel
===================
A fight explodes at the dinner table. So we disengage. I go off to our bedroom. You turn on the TV. After 15 minutes we get back together. We're both still ready to fight. But at least for now, we can think clearly. It's time to say how we feel.

Saying how we feel is something that people naturally do when they fight. We say things like "how could you forget to pay the phone bill!?" or "I don't think you even care that I get my diploma next week" or "How would you like it if I joked about your weight!?" or "I'm just so tired from doing 12-hour shifts and I just want to sleep." Although it might seem like we only say these things because we want to point fingers, they actually serve a useful purpose: to get onto the same page.

When I fight, it's because I feel threatened by something in the world. But if I can make you understand how if I feel, then the world isn't so threatening any more. You can help me come up with solutions or give me support. Or you can change your own behavior so that your metaphorical elbow isn't in my ribs anymore.

For example. Shari Rose and I fight like this: I talks for 20 minutes straight but I take out my phone as soon as I open my mouth. Shari rightly gets irritated. But she went a long time without saying so - she'd just get mad with zero explanation. But one day she actually said how she feels. She said "no, I listened to you now you listen to me that's how it works!"

As you can imagine, that started a small fight. But because she said how she feels, I told me about my ADHD. And how I  get distracted but it's because my brain is wired differently, not because I don't care. That information made her feel better. It's still not clear what we should do about her turn to talk, but at least now we're figuring it out together.

----------------------
Don't Say how you Feel
----------------------
What you never say how you feel? If you can't me you to understand how you feel, then you're always going to feel slightly neglected by me in our relationship. If I can't understand you, then that means I can't help fix your problems. It also means I don't know how to change my your own behavior to make you comfortable. You will slowly learn that you can't rely on me and that will make us more likely to fight in the future. Unless we get on the same page, our fight will continue forever.

-------------------------
Technique: "I" Statements
-------------------------
Expressing your feelings is easier said than done. Even with your best intentions it might come out too aggressive, too long-winded, or just not quite how you really feel inside. To help you, practice using something called an "I" statement. An "I" statement is a statement about yourself; not about me. Begin with "I feel," "I want," or "I like." Or begin with "my" as in "my feelings," "my life," or "my job." A good example of an I statement is "I feel bad when we're late to the show." Or "It hurts MY feelings when you yell at me."

When it comes time to say how you feel, use an "I" statement. Say "I don't know why but it upsets me so much, but I can't stand that you aren't registerd to vote." Or "I wasn't trying to do anything wrong, I just bought all that frozen food because it was on sale." Or "It sets off my OCD when the car is parked all crooked." Or "I had a bad experience at public school and I really don't want to send our kid to one." Or "I'm so hungry and I'm really grumpy right now."

-------------------
Why Does this Work?
-------------------
An I statement works for several reasons.
1. It gets to the heart of the issue: YOU. I am a human being; this means that I assume every situation is about me. If you say anything critical to me, I assume that you're just trying to put me down. If you say "you don't care about getting anywhere on time," now the focus is on me. This gives me license to protest and fight and say "well YOU don't care that I work hard for this family!"

But the story changes if you keep focus on you. If you say "I feel bad when we're late to the movie," that takes all the wind out of my sails. You are insisting to me: "this isn't all about you Dorian. My goal in life is not to put you down. I have my own feelings. I just want to get to the movie on time and get the respect I deserve."

2. "I" statements humanize you. That is, they make you appear nonthreatening to me. I am a typical human being; this means that I prefer to see myself as a big victim and you as a big antagonist. If you say something even marginally critical such as "I don't like your tone of voice" I'll start telling you things like "I can talk however I want" and "you never like anything that I do."

But the story changes if you say "Dorian, your tone of voice HURTS MY FEELINGS." This tells me that you're not just a big antagonist; you're a human with your own feelings. In that case, I'll feel pretty bad about attacking you. I might even be willing to take responsibility for my own actions (gasp!).

========================
2.5 Listen to how I feel
========================
At this point in the timeline, we are engaged in heated conversation. You say something, I interrupt you. You say another thing while making wild gestures, I make a hurt expression. You make a correction, I ask a question, you ask god for an answer. There's a lot of energy and emotions flying through the air.

Although we appear to be having a logical converstation, appearances can be deceiving. We're still high-strung and we could easily escalate back into a fight. We aren't yet ready to talk facts - our focus is on calming ourselves down. To help yourself calm down, you've been saying how you feel. And to help me calm down, you need to listen to how I feel.

---------
Technique
---------
Listening is straightforward. As long as you keep quiet and open up your ears, you're doing all you need to do to have a successful conflict resolution. Just sit. And listen.

This is easier said than done. I might say things that don't make logical sense. I might say things that are untrue. I might mix up my timelines, stutter, pause to think, mispronounce words, lose track of my thoughts or get tongue-tied. Resist the temptation to interrupt me.

I'm also going to be negative. I might say things like "I don't need you babying me just because I'm sick" or "you never invite me when you go out with your friends" or "look I'm exhuasted I just need some space!" or "I don't want you hanging around that woman from work." Just let it all slide.

If you can listen without interrupting, anything else you do is fine. It's okay you stare at your feet instead of looking into my eyes. It's fine if you don't repeat what I say back to me or ask me pointed questions. You don't have to do active listening or reflective listening. And it's okay if you don't respond with phrases like "I understand" or "I really hear where you're coming from." Just listen, that's more than enough.

-------------------
Why does This Work?
-------------------
Listening diffuses a conflict because:
1. It softens me up. When you listen, it makes me feel like you care about me; like we're on a team. It makes me less defensive and more willing to return the favor. It makes me feel like I don't have to deal with my problems on my own.

2. Listening to me softens up you. It humanizes me in your eyes and makes you less likely to lash out at me. When you realize that I'm just a human being with my own feelings, you might see my actions in a different light.

----------
Objections
----------
You might say "wait a minute." Why should I allow you to say things don't make logical sense? How are we supposed to resolve a conflict based on inaccurate information? The reason that you listen without interrupting, regardless of the silly things I say, is that the listening process is not about my making sense. It's about self-expression. When you let me blabber, it makes me feel good.

On the other hand, making interruptions takes us further away from our goal. Cutting off my flow makes me feel like you don't care about me. It makes me feel claustrophobic and defensive. It makes me want to turn up my volume and do whatever it takes to get your attention. Even if you're just interrupting to say "actually we went to the mall on Thursday," or "that woman from work is named Sarah, not Stephanie." That only feeds my insecurites and negative thoughts. Don't take the chance.

----------
Boundaries
----------
While it's true that you should to listen to the things I say, you are under no obligation to let me abuse you. If I am yelling, calling you names, making accusations, or outright lying, then there is nothing for you to "listen" to. Disengage. Be an immovable object and do not reengage with me until I calm down.

This is easier said than done. I will do my best to gaslight you. I will insist that you "listen" to me ridicule your insecurities, tell you how bad you are, or explain how ofensive your inherrent personality is to me. For example, I might say that "you make me look stupid when you dance awkwardly like that" or "if you were a real man you would fight my ex boyfriend."

It is very difficult to disengage when I am saying things that hurt you. You'll want to leave but you'll feel guilty for doing it. You'll start to believe that you deserve the abuse. Trust your heart. If it feels wrong, then it is.

When you finally walk out the door, I might change tactics and become the victim. Now I'll say "wait I'm scared to be alone! You're just going to leave me here to suffer?" Or I'll bring up a trusted third party: "how could you treat me this way? If only your mother was alive to see this." Or I'll make threats: "if you walk out that door, consider this realtionship over" or "I'll kill myself if you leave!"

Be brave. There is never any reason why you shouldn't disengage. You must not be afraid to. If I'm going to kill myself over it, so be it. If our relationship can't withstand a simple disengage, then we don't have a real relationship. We have a dictatorship. In that case, there's nothing you can do to help me.

==========================================
2.7 Saying How we Feel: Advanced Technique
==========================================
Saying how you feel is easier said than done. You will find yourself taking your best shot at explaining your feelings, but continually missing the mark. Sometimes our words come out more negative than we intended. Other times, we choose perfectly accurate language, but it doesn't quite convey the emotional message that we want.

For example, you might want to say something matter of fact like "it makes me nervous when we go running from place to place." But it comes out as "don't you dare rush me when I'm trying to enjoy my weekend." You might want to say "sometimes your dad makes me nervous." But instead it comes out as "your dad is weird I'm not sitting next to him."

It might sound like a small change. But a small change could be the difference between a fight that lasts half an hour or a fight that lasts half a year. Get this part right. Study the following technique. 

------------------------
Techique: Act like Child
------------------------
Little kids have a painfully earnest way of expressing themselves. They come right out and say "you're hurting my feelings" or "I want to do it myself!" without considering the ramifications to their reputation or public image. They are dramatic and exagerated, leaving no room to mistake what kind of emotion they are feeling.

Try expressing yourself this way. Say things like "you have to to ask me nicely" or "I'm scared to be alone" or "It's my turn to drive the car" or "my coworker made me sad" or "that's not fair!"

Continue on to adopt a child's body language and facial expressions. If you're mad, jump up and down. If you're sad, perform a deep frown and hide your face with your hands. If you're frustrated, run in place and shake your head. If you want to get me to hurry up, say "pleeaaaaase will you hurry for the concert?" I you're sorry, look at your feet and say "Aaahhmm sorrrry." Even if you're mad, make a comically angry face, bounce your head and say "NO! No No No!"

Make it Harmless. And make it Huge.

-------------------
Why does This Work?
-------------------
Acting like a child is useful for many reasons
1. It is a huge relief. You might expect that it will be difficult to express yourself this way; but the truth is just the opposite. If you manage to you express yourself in the dramatic and unmistakable way of a child, it feels like you are unlocking your true feelings.

2. Talking like a little kid is disarming. I (your partner) have the ability to respond to almost anything you do or say as if you are threatening or criticizing me. But when you scream "you're hurting my feelings!!" while crouching down and hiding your face in your hands, I get caught way off guard. In that case I will not feel so good about angrily snapping at you. In fact, your earnest self-expression might make me feel more like an adult and encourage me to take responsibility for my actions (gasp!).

3. Final note. You might think that this 'talk like a kid' idea is just some quirky gimmick that you'll maybe try for fun. Not quite. This technique will save your life. Do this when you you're terrified. Do it when you want to scream and throw heavy shit. Do it when you can't find the words to express your how much you love me. Our relationship is all we have. Weak technique won't cut it.

============
3. Apologize
============
At this point in the timeline, we exploded at the dinner table. We did our best to disengage. When we calmed down a little bit, we told each other how we feel, and we listened to how we feel. By now, things are basically peaceful. We might be sitting on the couch side-by-side, half-gossiping about stuff that happened at work. But even though things seem peaceful, there's still a sense of anxiety in the air.

Just now, the outburst and subsequent argument, we hurt each other. We glared and yelled and said hurtful things. Those hurt feelings are right there at the surface. If we don't take responsibility, those hurt feelings will boil until they precipitate another fight. We need to apologize.

An apology doesn't have to be elaborate or elagant. It just needs to be sincere. Go ahead and say "I'm sorry" or "I apologize." That's more than enough. If you want to be even more specific, great. Say "I'm sorry that I told you that you're a fat cold fish" or "I'm sorry for losing my temper and breaking one of our vases." Fights often last several days. You might feel the tension when you come home from work. Come out and say "I want to apologize for what I said yesterday."

The point of this exercise isn't to find the right words or wait for the right moment. It's just to apologize and to mean it. Think back to the negative things that you said and did. Now take responsibility.

-------------------
Why Does this Work?
-------------------
An apology works for several reasons.
1. By apologizing to me, you show me that you care. After years of conflict, I've started to think you don't. I assume that you say mean things purely because you don't like me. By apologizing, you correct my negative thinking. It tells me that you do care, that you don't want me to feel hurt, and that you are willing to humble yourself. This establishes the prescedent that I am your priority and reinforces my belief that the two of us are on a team.

2. Apologizing also makes you nonthreatening. Our history has made me somewhat scared of you. I worry that you intend to hurt me again. But when you apologize, you show me that you are aware of your negative behavior. You don't do negative things because you enjoy it, you do it because you're a human being and you are imperfect. And you want to do better.

3. Apologizing makes me much more likely to apologize to you.

----------
Objections
----------
You might say "But what if it's not the right time to apologize? What if it's too soon? What if it's too late? What if I just come across sounding stupid?" It's easy to come up with reasons why you shouldn't do the right thing. But a sincere apology will almost always makes things better, not worse.

You might still object "but what if I'm opening up old wounds?" It's true, apologizing for a conflict that's already over can turn a peaceful evening into a tense one. But those old wounds are still right there beneath the surface. You may not notice them, but if you haven't apologized to me, then I am still hurting deep down. You're best off learning to apologize early and often.

Finally, you might object to the premise of making the first move. You might say "Why should I be the one to apologize? You hurt me too. You should apologize first." You're right, it's not fair. You deserve to an apology just as much as I do (if not more). But this technique isn't about pure fairness, it's about how to improve your own life. If you want to have a happy life, get used to being the bigger person. As things improve, I (your partner) will come around. 

======================
3.5 Ask for an Apology
======================
You are a human being. Just like me, you carry around hurt feelings which affect your self-esteem. You deserve an apology for the negative things that I did and said to you.

The apology will make you feel good. It will make you feel important and cared for. It will work wonders for your self-esteem and you outlook on life in general. Even if you also said and did negative things, you still deserve an apology.

Go ahead and ask for one. Say "I want an apology." Or try "I know I'm not perfect, but you should say Sorry too." Maybe there's something specific that you want an apology for. You might say "I didn't deserve to be called a fat cold fish" or "I want you to apologize for losing your temper and breaking one of our vases." Just ask. Ask and be sure you get it.

As a rule, you should try to apologize first before you ask for your apology. This is not because you don't deserve an apology as much as me (you definitely do). You apologize first because this will soften me up and give you the best chance of success. Get used to being the bigger person.

----------
Boundaries
----------
Even if you've already apologized to me, I will probably resist apologizing to you. There are a million ways for me to confuse you, put you down, or wiggle my way out.

1. I might get defensive and angry. I might say "perfect, now I'm the bad guy" or "are you crazy? you want me to say I'm sorry when we both just heard the shit that came out of your mouth?" Be an iron wall. Say "if you don't want to apologize to me, then I'm just gonna wait until you do." Remember the Rules for a Healthy Relationship. "If I got hurt, I deserve an apology."

2. I might try to rationalize. I'll tell you "I didn't say anything wrong so I'm not saying sorry" or "why do you want me to feel guilty? You need to let it go." Stand up for yourself. I (your partner) don't get to decide whether or not I did anything wrong. In a healthy relationship, I should attend to your feelings because I trust that you feel them. Say to me "I'm telling you I feel hurt and you need to take that seriously."

3. I might try to tell you that you are being too sensitive. I might say "you shouldn't feel bad just because I called you a fat cold fish. It was only a joke" or "my parents used to hit me every day, one smack's not gonna kill you." Stand up for yourself. Say "it doesn't matter if it was a joke" and "it doesn't matter how you were raised" "I deserve to be treated how I want to be treated."

-----------------
Technique: Own Up
-----------------
I might rightly point out that "you said mean things to me too." Go ahead and take responsibility. Acknowledge that you did the wrong thing: "I'm sorry that I said mean things to you. I am not proud of what I did." But insist that you deserve an apology too: "But my feelings were hurt too. I am a good person. If my feelings were hurt, then I deserve an apology."

----------
Objections
----------
If I really resist hard, you might start to feel that the apology isn't worth it. You might think to yourself "I feel fine. I don't need an apology that badly." Don't go down this road. A healthy relationship has no room for martyrdom. You don't avoid doing the right thing just because its hard. You do the right thing forever until it gets easy. If I resist or get defensive, you disengage and repeat until your message gets through.

======================
4. Making an Agreement
======================
At this point in the timeline, we exploded at the dinner table. We disengaged. We talked and listened. We apologized. We are relaxed. But even still there's a sense of anxiety in the air. We need to make an agreement.

Every fight happens for a reason. Suppose you've been saying to me "I don't want you to yell at me any more" and I've been saying to you "well I have a lot of serious anxieties and you can't just throw stuff out of the basement without telling me." Well then this fight happened, at least in part, because I yell and because you keep trying to throw things out of the basement. It's nice that we made peace and are sitting on the couch, but if we don't plan ahead, this same fight is going to keep happening over and over. What we need to do is make an agreement. We will come up with a creative plan of action for how to prevent the same fight from breaking out in the future, and make a serious agreement to stick to that plan.

This is nearly word for word the sort of plan I made with Shari. You say "I want you to promise me that you won't yell at me any more even if you get mad." I say "okay I'll do my best but I've been yelling at my family my whole life and I'm gonna slip up sometimes." You say "It's okay to slip up as long as you try. Just know that if you start yelling at me, I'm gonna walk out the room." And I say "that's fine, that's actually good because once I start yelling I can't really stop."

That's a good agreement. It's realistic. Its reciprocal. But of course, no fight is one-sided. We have to address my feelings to.

So I say "I want you to promise me that you won't throw anything out of the basement without telling me first." And you say "I want to say yes, but that's not really a fair way to ask me to live. This is my house too and I should be allowed to throw boxes out of the basement." So I say "but what if I"m saving them? I have a lot of anxiety about this." So you say "okay, what if we go downstairs right now, and you can chose a pile of things for me to throw out." And I say "okay, but you promise you won't "throw any more out when I'm gone?" And you say "yes I promise."

---------------------
Ask for what you need
---------------------
To keep a fight from starting again, you need to ask for whatever makes you feel safe, wanted, and happy. Don't try to sugarcoat your statements or beat around the bush. Come right out and say "I need this house to stay clean" or "I can't be driving across town to pick you up every night" or "I need a vacation" or "I want to have kids" or "your cousin can not say here any more" or "You have a drinking problem and you need treatment."

Oliver says:
state you position no matter how crazy it is. negotiating technique
you never negotiate from the reasonable position first. cause then you're always going shift

Acknowledge the difference between dialectic and rhetoric.
In the beginning, all the techniques are based on rhetoric. Careful use of langugae to elicit an emotional response
Negotiations have to be ialectic. Rational solution that satisfies both parties.
(hostage negotions)
(it's funny because it's about emotions)

---------------------
Listen to what I need
---------------------
As a human beings, I tend to think that I'm the only person with legitimate needs. I'm the one that makes sense, but you're just plain crazy. Don't fall into this trap. When I ask for what I need, listen respect what I ask for, no matter how crazy it sounds. I might say "I need you to wash the dishes with a toothbrush" or "I can't sleep unless it's 85 degrees in the house" or "I want to quit my job and become a beekeeper" or "I want to go off my medication and start doing hypnosis." It doesn't matter if I have mental illness and you're neurotypical. It doesn't matter if I have an 8th grade education and you have a PhD. This is about feelings, not rocket science. And you must be willing to talk it through. Talk the feelings through.

-----------
Objections
-----------
You might say "but what if you ask for something crazy that I don't feel good about doing?" For example "I don't want to wash the dishes with a toothbrush, I can't live that way." Or "I'm not sleeping in an 85 degree house, that's not natural." You are correct: you don't have to do what I want. You don't "have" to do anything you're not comfortable with (in fact it's your obligation to know your boundaries). But even though you don't have to do what I say, you have to respect the fact that I said it. Try to trust me.

===============
4.5 Talk it out
===============
Talking it out is a process of cutting out the fat and getting down to the root of what we really need. Whatever we each asked for at the beginning, we're probably actually willing to settle for something different. We just don't realize it yet. Throw out suggestions, make trades, be creative. Say "I don't want to wash the dishes with a toothbrush. But what if you do all the dishes and I take out the trash." Or "what if we just eat off paper plates?" Or "Does it really need to be a toothbrush? What if I just promise to stop leaving little food crust on the spoons." Or "Ok I'll use the toothbrush. But only for a week, and then I'll decide if I'm gonna keep doing it." Or "I can't do the toothbrush thing. Is there anything else you can think to do?"

Be prepared to agree to stuff that sound weird. Be prepared to challenge me. Be prepared to get angry and fight all over again. And when that happens, get ready to disengage and calm down all over again.

-----------------------------
Technique: Say "I'm not Bad"
-----------------------------
When we negotiate, I'm going to try to tell you that your needs are not legitimate: they are childish, selfish, unrealistic, shameful. I have developed this misconsception because I have never participated in a healthy relationship before. 

Throw me off balance by saying this: "I'm not bad." Brazenly say other positive things about yourself: "I'm good" "It's okay to for me to say how I feel" "My needs are good and right." Watch my jaw hit the floor.

This technique works because
1. You are saying something I can't disagree with.
2. It makes me want to treat you as if you are good. If you're so sure that you're good, then you must be.
3. It lets me know that it's okay for me to also say "I'm good too." Now we're both good. Now we're two good people having an argument instead of two villains.

Follow it up by saying the same thing to me. Tell me "you're not bad" "you're good" "your needs are good and right." Watch as I become knocked out completely: "I'm good and right? Oh. You know I didn't really mean all that stuff I said about you being a lazy shit right?"

----------
Boundaries
----------
I might use this opportunity to ask for "needs" of mine which directly infringe on your life.
1. I might tell you I "need" you to stop seeing your mother on the weekends or you "need" to lend me money. I'll might lay claim to your body by saying I that you "need" to have sex with me or that I "need" to hit you sometimes when I get mad.

Stand firm. Practice saying the word "no" (It's not easy. It takes practice). 

2. I might try to belittle the things you ask for. If you say "I want more time with my dog" I'll say "why? she's just a dog. Am I not more important than a dog?" I'll do this especially if you have an anxiety or a kink that's off the beaten path. If you say "I need to leave one light on downstairs when we go to sleep" I'll say "that's just a waste of electricity. Be an adult."

Don't be fooled. There are no wrong feelings and no such thing as "getting over" your feelings.

3. I might argue that my bad behavior is part of who I am. If you say "I don't like when you're saracastic with me" I'll say "I thought you liked my voice. I'm not going to change my voice for you." I might try to convince you that YOU are the one who needs to change: "look, you can't let the way I talk affect you so much. You're only upset because you allow yourself to feel that way."

Don't be fooled. If you're not happy with how I treat you, you are not obligated to tolerate it. Remind me that you're not asking for a favor, you're expressing a need. If I am not willing or able to treat you the way you want to be treated, then that's nobody's fault. But it does mean that something big needs to change.

4. I might claim that any criticism of me is a sort of violence. Suppose you say "Dorian, you need to stop making jokes about me in front of your parents." I might tell you "I can't handle this talking about this right now, I have to study for finals. Don't be selfish." I might go the opposite route and get dramatically miserable with guilt: "I'm such a bad person... I'm horrible... I don't deserve you... why are you trying to make me feel guilty?"

Don't let me take over. Remember that you are never wrong to say how you feel. Your feelings are not a form of violence; they are feelings. You are never hurting anyone by expressing how you feel.

===============
4.7 Shake on It
===============
Eventually we'll find terms that work for both of us: "I promise to listen better when you talk to me, but you have to give me 20 solid minutes of alone time when I get back from work."

Make this agreement explicit. Even though we talked it over, I'm going to try to wiggle out of my end of the bargain. I'll say "yea sure, I'll try to leave you alone sometimes." Don't leave any loose ends. Maybe look me in the eyes or have me repeat the agreement back to you ir write it down if necessary. These little moments of understanding are what will keep us from fighting again in the future.

Remember that this agreement is supposed to change over time. Don't worry about getting it perfect for eternity, just make it to work for us here and now.

--------------------------
Technique: Say "You Trust"
--------------------------
During the negotiating, I might be hesitant to accept any deal. In the Cold aftermath of the fight I might get scared that you won't wash the dishes properly. I might start saying "no, no, I'm just going to do all the dishes myself."

Command me this: "you trust." I tell this to Shari all the time. "You Trust, Shari Rose." Insist to me that you intend to follow through on what you say. Insist to me that I can't control everything in our relationship. To make us work, I have to let you prove yourself.

----------------------------
What if there's No Solution?
----------------------------
Sometimes we comes to an impasse. We talk and and calculate and after a long time we conclude that there's no way for us to both get what we need. For example, I want to live closer to my family and you want to stay where we are. Living close to my family is an absolute must for me - I'm losing my mind being apart from them. Moving away means destabilizing your career and leaving your friends - it's just not an option. In that case, there's only one solution: break up. And that's okay. Breakup up is sad, it's difficult, it can be completely terrifying. But when you're breaking up for the right reasons, you know that both of your lives will be better off at a result. Be brave.

----------
Boundaries
----------
Never threaten to break up. But its good to talk about it if you mean it.

=========
5. Repeat
=========
A successfully navigated conflict will leave you feeling very very relieved. Yes, we'll be sad. But there's also a sense of freedom. Of accomplishment, even.

That said, don't think we can have one good fight and get it over with. Expect to have many different fights about the same few subjects. Or even to reopen the exact same fight a week later. That's fine. They'll get easier. Consider them to be milestones. If we do them right, each fight will bring us closer together.
